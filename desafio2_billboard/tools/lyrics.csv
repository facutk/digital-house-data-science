Question: Tell me how you feel about this

I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent
Question: How'd you like this knowledge that I brought
Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is to front
If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on noone else to give you what you want

Savage Garden,I Knew I Loved You,"Hmm ohh, I will come
Maybe it's intuition
Somethings you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only a sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for, I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

Ooh hoo ooo, hoo hoo ooo ohh
A thousand angels dance around you
  (Ooh hoo, hoo ooo hoo ooo hoo hoo hoo)
I am complete now that I have found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

"Iglesias, Enrique",Be With You,"Monday night and I feel so low
Count the hours they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul

City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I'm all alone

Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby just give me a sign

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

I can't sleep I'm up all night
Through these tears I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life

Don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you some how

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

Don't let me down
Come to me now

I got to be with you somehow
And now that you're gone
Who am I with-out you now
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

Sisqo,Incomplete,"Whoo
Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Said without you girl ahh
Listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Oh yeah that without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Without you girl
Without you girl my life
Without you girl my life, my life is incomplete
Without you girl my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"

This feeling inside me

And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark

Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

Vertical Horizon,Everything You Want,"Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know"
Creed,With Arms Wide Open,"Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change

matchbox twenty,Bent,"If I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk

If I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around I'll smile again

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

Can you help me I'm bent
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

If I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
Could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot

I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

Can you help me I'm bent
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

Start bending me, it's never enough
As I feel all your pieces
Start bending me, keep bending me
Oh, until I'm completely broken in

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

Can you help me I'm bent
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me will let them
Without understanding
Here I go there again

Can you help me I'm bent
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Yeah, you're breaking me in

Nastradamus remix
For the world
Make it real, baby
Uh, Desert Storm, baby
Uh, check it, this for you

Let's show the world you're my golden girl, when we shoppin'
They see us on the streets, they say, ""Son, scooped a hot one""
You taste like banana cake, you shaped like the number eight
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin' knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh

Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Players haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, uh huh
Typically I wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, ow

Oh, I'mma be here night after night to
Feel your lovin' arms around me, baby
Baby, baby, baby, you make it all right
No one but you, baby, can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel, whoa

We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last

Don't let our love end
Oh, don't you let it end
Make it last forever and ever
Thank God, I found you

Your touch is wonderful
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you, yeah

Nothing, no one
Could compare to what we have
Love, it feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine

We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last

Don't let our love end
Make it last forever and ever
Thank God, I found you

What, a thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matchin' brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap root of Valentino
And B5 become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz, you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'mma touch you in the wrong places

Or we could walk through the park
Above in all faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin', Boo, the type I'd give my last name to
At Lovers Lane put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doin' our thing
Fog the windows, gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to real, that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus

We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last

I was so lost without you
I was lost without you
My every wish and dream
Became reality

2000, Nastradamus
I'm overwhelmed with what I do
And I'm so thankful

Thank God, I found you
I was so lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

But sometimes I blame my whole life
Can last forever, babe
Thank God, I found you"
"Hill, Faith",Breathe,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way"

3 Doors Down,Kryptonite,"I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
And I feel there is nothing I can do, oh yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
No no no no no no no

You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, if not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
No no no no no no no, no no no no no no no

"Aguilera, Christina",I Turn To You,"When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way, when I'm scared losing ground
When my world is going crazy you can turn it all around
And when I'm down you're there pushing me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got

For a shield, from the storm for a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you
For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on
For everything you do, for everything that's true, I turn to you

When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again
I can do anything 'cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me
And when I need a friend you're always on my side
Giving me faith taking me through the night

For a shield, from the storm, for a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you
For the strength to be strong and for the will to carry on
For everything you do I turn to you yeah

For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain
For truth that will never change for someone to lean on
But for a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one who I can run to oh I turn to you

For a shield from the storm, for a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you
For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on
For everything you do, for everything that's true
For everything you do, for everything that's true, I turn to you"

Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the, ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
Feminist women love Eminem
Chigga chigga chigga, ""Slim shady, I'm sick of him

Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss""
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals"", well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha
Guess there's a slim shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"

Baby talk to me, tell me what's on your mind, baby oh

Oh baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thang, I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans, my thug appeal
Do you like it when a man can keep it real? Oh

Oh baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh baby

Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good you make me feel inside
There's not a single question that we can't make this right
'Cause it's you I need every day and night

Oh ho ho baby yeah

Oh baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh baby, bring it all to me

Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good
Now the love is gone

Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?

In the backseat piece spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me you was all about
But I'm having doubts
'Cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you?
When I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks
And no more hanging brigets around your neck, babe

Does he lace you with the finer things?

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become wild and free I could feel the sun

Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
Never say forever gaze guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control are you with me now

Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?

Nine Days,Absolutely (Story Of A Girl),"This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope
But she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Makin' her promises never for real

As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear when you look in the mirror
So how do ya choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

And how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day
How did we wind up this way
Watchin' our mouths for the words that we say

As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When you're walking to far for the price of your shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl

I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
A pretty face she hid from the world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there

I absolutely love her when she smiles

Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on let's go there, let's ask, â€½Can we stay?â€

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on let's go there, let's ask, â€½Can we stay?â€

Alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine

Used to struggle
Now I both count the g's with me
Pop the champagne
Let's take a sippy-sippy
Describe you I try to
You're my wifey
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Kenny G,Auld Lang Syne (The Millenium Mix),
Sonique,It Feels So Good,"You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe
It's totally bona fide

It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

1-Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touching means so much
When I'm alone, I'm not
It's you that always makes me laugh

Oh, oh, baby

Oooooh, to understand
How I feel, deep inside
Oh oh, you make feel
All I need to feel
Yes, in my heart
(repeat 1)

Oh, oh, baby"
"Spears, Britney",Oops!.. I Did It Again,"yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me

Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above

I'm not that innocent
You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me

Baby, oh
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above

I'm not that innocent
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
""All aboard""

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops!...You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent"

Everclear,Wonderful,"Hey, ain't life wonderful?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Isn't it wonderful?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Life is so wonderful
Isn't everything wonderful?
Isn't it wonderful now?

I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them
I want the things that I had before
Like a star wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry
Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home
Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world is so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't wanna hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna hear you say
You both have grown in a different way
No, no, no, no

I don't wanna meet your friends
And I don't wanna start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Some days I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

No, please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
No, please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

Everything is wonderful now
Everything is wonderful now
Everything is wonderful now

Ja Rule,Between Me And You,"Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, baby

Yo now when I first met her all I thought was thong thong-thong
Like, 'lose the lame, we can get our freakin' on'
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha shut yo' mouth pull the drop out
Creep at a low speed 'cause homey probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stilleto
Way up in the air like I think he's here

'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you, with you
Homey be checkin' up on you, on you
But if that nigga only knew, only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
Well now it's startin' to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said, ""Money ain't a thing""
It's been close to few, something even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, baby

Girl it's on again every year we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the day ends that's when it all begins
You wit him here's my room key holla at me
While you thinka think I'ma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin' you love c'mon love

We could go there me and you creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin' awake with new light
If you lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz, it is what it is
Nigga livin' his life and that's my bitch
You know I gotta wife, let's keep this thing tight, baby


Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, baby

Don't let the word get out baby
This is strictly between me and you baby
If they knew we were doin' what we were doin' it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancun's-and I, love
The way we get away throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
Fuck life, we live life, this is our life, live your life

'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you, with you
Shorty be checkin up on you, on you
But if baby girl only knew, only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you baby
Did I ever tell you my man love what you do
That little thing with yo' tongue you the best, who knew?
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Now every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, me and you
'Cause every little thing that we do, that we do
Should be between me and you, me and you
The freaky things that we do, that we do
Let's keep between me and you, baby

That we do
Me and you
That we do
Me and you
That we do
Me and you
That we do
Me and you"
"Rimes, LeAnn",I Need You,"I don't need a lot of things, I can get by with nothing
With all the blessings life can bring, I've always needed something
But I've got all I want when it comes to loving you
You're my only reason, you're my only truth

I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through
I need you

You're the hope that moves me to courage again, oh yeah
You're the love that rescues me when the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing 'cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now 'cause you've brought me too far

I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through
I need you, oh yes I do

I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through
I need you, oh yes I do

I need you, I need you, I need you"
Smash Mouth,Then The Morning Comes,"Paint the town
Take a bow
Thank everybody
You're gonna do it again

You are the antibody
Mind soul, and zen

And the world's a stage
And the world's a faze
And the end is near

So push rewind

Like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning come

Take your knocks
Shake them off
Duck everybody
You're gonna take them again
You are you foe

You are the paparazzi
You are the tragedian

And the world's a craze

You're gonna do it again

The way the you walk
It's just the way that you talk

And every single day is just a fling
And when it comes it moves so slow
Kinda like it's saying I told you so
Looking back before she goes
Tomorrow's gonna hurt

And the world's a stage
And the world's a faze
And the end is near

So push rewind
Just in time
Thank anybody

It's just the way that you walk
It's just the way that you talk
Like it ain't no thing

Jay-Z,I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me),"I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know
It ain't where I been, it's where I'm 'bout to go
Take it from the top

Now I just wanna love you, you know I love you
But be who I am, I know you love me
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them

Drunk off Crist', Mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all""

It gets better, ordered another round
It's about to go down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You gotta give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

I told you, save the narrative, you savin' it up for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'm a go
How, much I'm a spend but you already know

Zip, zero, stingy with Dinero
Might buy you Crist' but that about it
I might light your Crist' but that about it

Okay, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You better give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know
It ain't where I been, but where I'm 'bout to go

Now I just wanna love you
But be who I am
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Romancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin

Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You better give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You gotta give it to me, I said give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me"

"Spears, Britney",From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart,"""Never look back"", We said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear all my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know?
Still I miss you somehow

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

""Baby,"" I said, ""Please stay""
Give our love a chance for one more day, oh
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

You promised yourself but to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now

There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose

And all the time moves on and on
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong

If there's a reason
It's lost on me
Maybe we'll be friends
I guess we'll see

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Turn around, your back on each other
It's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around let's turn on each other

Good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
What a good idea

I remember the stupid things, the mood rings
The bracelets and the beads
Nickels and dimes, yours and mine, did you cash in all your dreams?
You don't dream for me, no, you don't dream for me, no
(Goodbye, goodbye)
But I still feel you pulse like sonar from the days in the waves

That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to say
The girl is like a sunburn
I would like to say
She's like a sunburn
(She's like a sunburn)
She's like a sunburn"
Red Hot Chili Peppers,Otherside,"How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up, it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
How long? I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever"

Barenaked Ladies,Pinch Me,"It's the perfect time of the year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering every thing's a mess

There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When ya realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with no clothing on

Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Then sleep away the afternoon

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When ya realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

Pinch me, pinch me
'Cos I'm still asleep
Please God tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed the car and leave this town
Will you notice that I'm not around?

I could hide out under there
I just made you say underwear
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone
Then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'cos the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When ya realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

Try to figure out what all this is for
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Try to figure out what all this is for"
Jagged Edge,He Can't Love U,"I ain't no hata or nothing
But he can't love you like I can
Trust me

Ooh, ooh, ooh

As the clock strikes twelve
I'm sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave
And baby I know that I did my share
Of things to deceive you
I'm just trying to get an understanding
Of what to do
Cause I'm half way going crazy
Girl they can't fade me

He can't love you like I love you

And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

I stop, and I wait, and I think
That I never met someone to make me feel
Like I'm ready to love
So I gotta do what I gotta do
Just to keep you
Keep you here with me baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you boo
And I can't go a day without your loving
Baby I can't live without you

I know you know
No matter if you want it baby
Ain't no ifs, or buts, or maybes
And I know that one day you'll see
That he can't really love you like I love you

He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl

He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl

He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl

He can't, he can't love you girl

Sting,Desert Rose,"I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall"

But I don't fuckin' feed 'em

First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talki'n 'bout, what's the reasons?
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em

In the cut where I keep 'em
Till I need a nut, till I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin' 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck

Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up

Shit I parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'

Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe
Then sit back and peep my scenario

Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck a scary hoe
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say, there he go

Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab

Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' slab
Livin' ghetto fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I

You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on

Pump it up in the prozone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the Glock start poppin' like ozone

All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all

If I wasn't rappin' baby, I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chromin' shinin' sippin' daily, no rest until whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all know bout them Texas boys

There Is Nothing Left To Lose
Learn To Fly
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying ( trying)
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
I think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything is alright..
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try and make this life my own"

And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With my arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters

And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a nigga like me along time ago

Westlife,Swear It Again,"I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go?
The only joy that I have ever known

Girl, they were lying
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know

Just gave it up, they wanna let it go

But we're still trying
So, you should know this love we shared was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street, just you and I
Just you and I
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I

I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

All over again
Some people say
That everything has got it's place and time

Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying

'Cause in your eyes
I see a love that burns internally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You know I'm not lying
Shall there be times we wanna say goodbye but even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad

I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

The more I know of you
Is the more I know I love you

And the more that I'm sure
I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me
The more that I know...
That I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I (I'm never gonna say goodbye)

I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again
All over again
All over again
I'd swear it all over again"
Train,Meet Virginia,"She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
You catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day, but wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing, about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna be queen""

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the president

And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the president
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back, as she screams
""I don't really wanna live this life"", no, no, no

She only drinks coffee at midnight
But the moment is not right
And the time is quite, unusual

You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body, unusual

Meet Virgina, I can't wait to
Meet Virginia, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Well, she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Well, she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life

Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen, ah, ah
I don't really wanna be the queen, ah, ah
I don't really wanna be the queen, ah, ah
I don't really wanna live here"
"Thomas, Carl",I Wish,"It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it hurts
Someone that you lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love from me
But she still belongs to someone

I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
Wish I never, wish I never"

This Time Around
This Time Around
It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie

I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why

I heard they told her it was to tell and live or to die

I didn't know her but I know why she lied

I didn't know her but I know why she died


(Yeah) You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

And we won't go down


I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head

Well I feel ashamed of the things that I said

Put on these chains and you can live a free life

Well I'd rather bleed just to know why I die


You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

And we won't go down

And we won't go down

And we won't go down

And we won't go down

All I know is that fear has to go

This time around


I've started feeling like I don't want to fight

Give in to the given and put out the light

Cannons a blazing shower these moonlit skies

Then I remember and I know why he died

Do you know why I die?


You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

You can't say I didn't give it

I won't wait another minute

We're on our way this time around

You can't say I didn't give it"

But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
while the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club we can do it
in the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top
Lick it don't stop, keep the door locked while the boat rock 
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait til the show stop
or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
or in back of a classroom
how ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
see I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
and if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free 
and the tell me what they fantasy
like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
with the candle lit you give it up till they go out
or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
cause you know I got sold out
or red carpet dick could just roll out
go 'head and scream you can't hold out
we can do it in the pouring rain
runnin the train when it's hot or cold out
how 'bout in the library on top of books
but you can't be too loud
you wanna make a brother beg for it
give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
we can do it in the white house
tryna make them turn the lights out 
champaign with my campaign let me do the damn thing
what's my name, what's my name, what's my name a sauna, jacuzzi
in the back row at the movie
You can stratch my back and rule me
You can push me or just pull me
on hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
that's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, ruff sex make it hurt
in the garden all in the dir
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
on the top of my escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade; tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat! Factories or on hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game; dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

Cheap watches turned to Cartiers
Locals turned to gators
Point 3's turn to 5 c's all these car keys
Jump in the benz and hit The Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star

[Chorus: Lil' Zane w/ variations]

Heard everybody doing good and i like that
Irv said y'all got the block locked
He tell me K and big Chris driving drop tops
Flossing I'm getting letters hard to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail hope they like that
Prayin that the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screens 
He ain't easy as the shit seems
Throwin up my dueces as a pass by
Showing love to the southside all the players outside
And we gon' spend G's tonight 
Hotel's on me shit's free tonight
C'mon!

That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Ohhhh how we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Ohhhh then I asked her can I see you again
She said yes! and I said wow
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I wanna be
She's the one I long for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Ohhh then it happened one night looking in her eyes
Ohhh when I popped the question much to my sur-prize
She said yes! and I said wow
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So we called a preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since

She said yes! and I said wow
She said when and I said how about right now
Love can't wait then I asked if she believed in fate

"Spears, Britney",Lucky,"This is a story about a girl named Lucky?

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go?
""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say?

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go?
""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say?

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night

""Best actress, and the winner is?Lucky!""
""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky""
""Oh my god?here she comes!""

Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night"
Savage Garden,Crash And Burn,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild, wild heart

I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief
And people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door
And you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one-way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away
And you feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone

Because there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild, wild heart

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
And if you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone
  (Alone)

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
  (You're not alone)
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
  (No no you're never alone)
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
  (You're not alone)
If you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone
  (If you need to crash then crash and burn you're not alone)

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart

Kandi,Don't Think I'm Not,"Now, I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie

But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're dogging me

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When I try to get your attention
You ignore me everytime
You were so caught up doing your dirt
That you didn't notice mine

Well, I couldn't put up with your scheming
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs won't make it right
But it's suiting me just fine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

Don't be surprised to know that sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it but it's real
The game is so real, so real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it, when you're out in the club

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine"
Sammie,I Like It,"Girl I wish that I could spend time with you
Each and everyday.


Playing on my love emotions
That's the thing that's got me open
And I don't know what it takes to let you know
You're my girl, to let you know you're my baby


And even when they say we won't stay around


If they only knew that we were meant to be together
Forever and ever whatever there's no better than me
and you girl that's why I write you love letters
saying...


Chorus
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it


Sometimes I wanna be the one you be checking for
Can I get a second for.


Me and you to be alone tell me if you think it's wrong
Love is nothing but the time it takes to say I'm on your mind
Let me tell you, I'm always there oh yea


Let's get a little time a way go to the movies on a Saturday


Meet me at the finish line
So I can tell you one more time
Girl you know I'm not scared to let you see that


Chorus
I like the way you look at me


I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it.
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby.
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it


When I think of you
I think of all the things we could do
And I never wanna let you go
And as long as I can let you know
I hope we stay down forever.


I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it.


Chorus
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it


I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like, baby baby, baby baby.
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it."
Goo Goo Dolls,Broadway,"Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old man’s bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night’s gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it of your mind
You talk about the world
Like it’s someplace that you’ve been

You see you’d love to run home
But you know you ain’t got one
'Cause you’re livin’ in a world
That you’re best forgotten around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old man’s bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues
When you're sober up for fun

Your anger don’t impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell
On the losers day parade

You see you’d love to run home
But you know you ain’t got one
’Cause you’re livin’ in a world
That you’re best forgotten

When you’re thinkin’ of a joke
And nobody’s gonna listen
To one small point
I know they been missin’ round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old man’s bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You see you’d love to run home
But you know you ain’t got one
’Cause you’re livin’ in a world
That you’re best forgotten

When you’re thinkin’ of a joke
Do you think that they’ll listen
To the one small point
I know they been missin’ round here, round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old man’s bar
Waitin' for his turn to die"
"Moore, Mandy",I Wanna Be With You,"I try but I can't seem to get myself
To think of anything but you
Your breath on my face
Your warm gentle kiss, I taste the truth
I taste the truth

You know what I came here for

So I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms
Who holds you tight
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say

There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight
Like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted

So much to be here before (To feel before)

How beautiful it is
Just to be like this

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms
Who holds you tight

I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you
Oh baby
I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name
Take my hand
And make my wish
Baby, your command
Yeah
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
(I wanna be) I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you (Yeah)

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be)

Dr. Dre,Forgot About Dre,"Y'all know me, still the same ol' G
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me
'Cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries

Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, ""Muthafuck the police""

Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop
Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA
One day I was walkin' by
Wit a walkman on
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot wit his Karl Kani

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out wit two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'm a kill you and them
Loud ass muthafuckin barkin' dogs

And when the cops came through me
Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
They still wouldn't found out
From here on out it's the chronic two
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew

Slim Shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies
Sorry Doc, but I've been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me
You muthafuckas would stop comin' up to me
Wit your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last C.D. was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got's new company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of The Compton

I told em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mould 'em all?
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off

I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddled in the cabbage patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips

"Messina, Jo Dee",That's The Way,"Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take your drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find out it's a winding road

I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Then somethin' else knocks me down

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows

You live, you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is

One fine day you wake up
Completely, hopelessly fallen in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is that the man's not sure

Another guy will give you everything
Only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well I know from experience
Nothings ever gonna make perfect sense

Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows

You live, you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is

Yeah, they say your soul is growin'
But sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'

And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
And that's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows

And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows

You live, you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
Oh, and that's the way it is

Oh, that's the way it is, yeah

I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I coudn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrended just to hear your voice
I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live with out you
and maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there is something baby that you need to know
That deep inside me i feel like Im dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies,
The courage that I need to live
The air that I Breathe
Carino mio, my worlds become so empty
My day's are so cold and lonely,
and each night I taste
The purest of Pain

I wish I could tell you I'm feeling better every day
That it din't hurt me when you walked away

You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and everybody know
Your old man say, ""You're stupid"", you be like, ""So?

'Cause youse a soft type nigga, fake up north type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter

The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin' his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out

Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? Who? Some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest

"McGraw, Tim",My Next Thirty Years,"I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord, have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey, my next thirty years, I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years, I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here in my next thirty years

Oh, my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years"

Best Of Intentions
Capo 1st

I had big plans for our future,
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise,
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle,
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser,
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner,
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember,
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

Chorus:
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
to show my love for you.
And if you could read my heart,
then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of_ intentions

Instrumental: 

Chorus

So here I am asking forgiveness,
and praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted,
girl I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better,
you won't find devotion more true
Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl I've had the best of intentions,
Yes, I've had the best of intentions
loving you"

Hoku,Another Dumb Blonde,"I think that it's time that I should just let you go
So I'll tell it to your face instead of
Tellin' it to you on the phone

You see I thought that you were special, baby
Something unique but lately I've come to find
That you're not really interested in my heart or mind

That's alright, that's okay, you never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright, that's okay, I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me no, no, 'cause it's not me no, no, oh no

Last night I went to a party hoping I'd see you there
And sure enough you were hanging on some other girl
Playin' with her hair

And I overheard you tellin' her the very same thing
You said to me  the night before
Hook, line and sinker you were walking with her out the door

That's alright, that's okay, you never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright, that's okay, I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me no, no

You are just a little trophy hanging on your arm so
All your friends are seein' you got it goin' on but I see what you are
So clearly but baby, baby, that's not alright with me

That's alright, that's okay, I never loved you anyway
That's alright that's okay, you never loved me anyway
You never loved me then it's alright, then it's alright
Yeah, yeah, I said yeah, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Go ahead and find what you need

That's alright, that's okay, you never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's alright, that's okay, I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde"
"Houston, Whitney",I Learned From The Best,"Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time? Oh, no no

Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back
In my life? Oh

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye, baby

Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing
On my mind

Now you say you're sorry and you've changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
I learned from the best, I learned from you"

Mary Mary,Shackles (Praise You),"Whoo!

In the corners of mind
I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free
'Cause you see I have been down for so long

Feel like all hope is gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon lose my mind

But I know you wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need you to lift this load
'Cause I can't take it anymore

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You

"Carey, Mariah",Crybaby,"Yo what's happenin'?
What you're cryin' for?
You know you look too damn good to be cryin'
Come here
How about a player
DPG style, you know, you know

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay so it's 5 a.m and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep

I finally changed my number got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're
Tryin' to reach me probably because you see that
I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Sipping Bailey's Cream by the stereo
Trying to find relief on the radio
I'm suppressing the tears but they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is a song I wrote

When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two
And I try to forget you

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Baby hear me when I say let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time and worry how he handle thangz
Baby hear me when I say a playa feelin' good today
Don't even waste your time watch how I handle thangz
Man you's a fool for this
But on the real dog I'm cool with this we do and this
D O double G Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

I don't get no sleep, I'm half awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfectly

I cry, I cry, I cry
Oh I gotta give me some sleep
And I cry, cry, cry, cry
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry
You and I
Over you and me

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone

Madonna,American Pie,"A long long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so

Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singing
""Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

Well now, in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

We started singin'
""Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin'"
"Jones, Donell",Where I Wanna Be,"I said, ""I left my baby girl a message
Sayin'  won't be coming home, I'd rather be alone""
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat

If she'll give me some time I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, ""How could you let this be?""
I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh no, no

Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
I think about my life and what matters to me the most

Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, ""How could you let this be?""
I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby

See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, ""How could you let this be?""
And I just need time to see where I wanna be

See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad ow that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, ""How could you let this be?""
And I just need time to see where I wanna be

See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, ""How could you let this be?""
And I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

I'm sorry, baby"
"Paisley, Brad",We Danced,"The bar was empty, I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in, I said, ""I'm sorry but we're closed""
And she said ""I know but I'm afraid I left my purse""
I said, ""I put one back behind the bar, I bet it's probably yours""

And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment, there was never any doubt
I had found the one that I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin', when she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt

And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close

And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played, we held each other close
And we danced, yeah, we danced"
Lonestar,What About Now,"The sign in the window said, ""For sale or trade""
On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made
Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

And that road rolls out like a welcome mat
I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
We always said, ""Someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town""

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about

What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the Interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on
And makes another round, what about now?

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about

What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the Interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on
And makes another round, what about now?

We could hang around this town
Forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time
To take this chance

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about

What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the Interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on
And makes another round, what about now? Yeah

What about now?"
"Backstreet Boys, The",The One,We do not have the lyrics for The One (Karaoke Version) [In the Style of Backstreet Boys] yet.
"Keith, Toby",How Do You Like Me Now?!,"I was always the crazy one
who broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number
on the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one
and a valedictorian
So under your number I wrote
call for a good time
I only wanted to get your attention
but you over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
and I played my guitar too loud

Chorus:
How do you like me now
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today
I couldn't make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and your always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby with your wake up call
...
Chorus 2x
...
Tell Me Baby!
I will preach on! haha

"Strait, George",The Best Day,"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman and sleepin' bags
Some fishin' poles, a cooler of Cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven, you're in Seventh Heaven
When you're goin' campin' in the wild outdoors
And as we turned off on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'Vette
I thought that boy would go insane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
We worked nights on end till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel, he said

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standin' in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Lookin' at him I say
""I can't believe, son, that you're grown""
He said

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreamin' day and night of bein' like you
Now it's me and her watchin' you and Mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life"

Musiq,Just Friends (Sunny),"Girl, I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order
For stepping to you this way
See I've been watching you for a while
And I just gotta let you know
That I'm really feeling your style

'Cause I have to know your name
And leave you with my number
And I hope that you would call me someday
If you want you can give me yours too
And if you don't I ain't mad at'cha
We can still be cool 'cause

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

Damn, I'm surprised that you called
'Cause the way you walked away
I thought I wasn't gon' see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your name
I thought that you were iggin' me
And wasn't diggin' me

But anyway what you doing tonight
I'll probably be with my peeps
If it's cool with you maybe we'll swing by
And you can just chill with us
Or you can just chill with me
Long as you're comfortable
And you feel secure when your with me 'cause

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

Oh, oh, baby yeah
Maybe we can go and see a movie girl
Or maybe we can hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do
Just let me know, it's up to you

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

Just chill and keep it real
Hang out, get nothin' from you
Oh no, oh no
We can just talk about you girl
Oh yeah
I'm just there for you anytime you need me"
"McEntire, Reba",What Do You Say,"Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said, ""Daddy, what are all those X's for?""
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
Started talkin' 'bout football as they drove right past

So what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words ohh, to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?

Seventeen years old
She was out with her friends
They started drinkin' at some party
Till she was three sheets to the wind
Her momma always told her
She could call no matter what
She was cryin' on the front steps
When her mom showed up

Well, what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words ohh, to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?

Sometimes you gotta listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think

Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps, she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holdin' on
She looks at him and says, ""I wanna go home""

But what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?

Ohh, just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?
Ooo, what do you say?"
"Braxton, Toni",Just Be A Man About It,"Hey, hey hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this pay phone real quick
Hey, hey Toni, it's me, I was just calling you know
Just calling to let you know, don't wait up for me tonight

Why are you calling me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're staying over your friends
'Coz you got a lot on your mind

Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me
Still you say that things have changed
So tell me what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space?
Just don't make no excuses, no no

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it

I can tell you wanna leave
Just be a man about it
So come and get your things and leave
Just be a man about it

I mean, you gotta understand I love you, you know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I Think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what you need, you know
I mean, I wanna love you, and I'm gonna love you, one day
But, you know I mean, you just gotta understand where I'm coming from

You say right now that you're not what I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may come around
And I'm supposed to let that go

But where the hell do you get off telling me your mama said
I'm not what you need?
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be
Just don't make no excuses, no no

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it

I can tell you wanna leave
Just be a man about it
So come and get your things and leave
Just be a man about it

Can you tell me how you can say you're in love
And then treat me so bad? Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe the way you handled things
You wouldn't lie if you were a man

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it

I can tell you wanna leave
Just be a man about it
So come and get your things and leave
Just be a man about it

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
You don't gotta lie to me
Just be a man about it"
"Iglesias, Enrique",Rhythm Divine,"Feel the rhythm

From the coast of Ipanema
To the island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Have to hold you in my arms now
There can never be another for me

All I need is the rhythm divine
Who lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica, yeah, say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion?
Can you taste our love's sweet wine?
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow's cares right out of your mind

As the music draws you closer
And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now
Where the night will take us, no one can tell

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica, yeah, say you'll be mine

Gonna have this feeling forever
Gonna live this moment together
Nothing else matters just you and the night
Follow on the wings of desire
Now the rhythm's taking you higher
No one can stop us from havin' it all
You are my heart, you are my soul

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica, yeah, say you'll be mine

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes

"Fabian, Lara",I Will Love Again,"Did I ever tell you how you live in me?
Every waking moment, even in my dreams
And if all this talk is crazy
And you don't know what I mean
Does it really matter just as long as I believe?

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking I will love again
Stronger than before, I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows, I will love again

People never tell you the way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly, if I knew it was for real
So if all this talk sounds crazy
And the words don't come out right
Does it really matter if it gets me through this night?

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking I will love again
Stronger than before, I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows, I will love again

If I'm true to myself
Nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on
Tell me what else can I do ?

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking I will love again
Stronger than before, I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows, I will love again

I will love again
One day I know, I will love again
You can't stop me from loving again
Breathing again, feeling again
I know, one day, I'll love again"
Bon Jovi,It's My Life,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""

"Evans, Sara",Born To Fly,"I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I say, ""Friend do you think I'll ever get there?""
Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me

So I confess my sins to the preacher
About the love I'd been prayin' to find
Is there a brown-eyed boy in my future?
And he says, ""Girl, you've got nothin' but time""

But how do you wait for Heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that you were born, you were born to fly

My daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is as steady as the sun
Oh you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run

Hey 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I want, wild and free

Oh how do you wait for Heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that you were born, you were born, yeah
You were born to fly

So how do you wait for Heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that you were born, you were born to fly, yeah
You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly, hey"
"Chesney, Kenny",I Lost It,"I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
So weak and tired I could barely stand
From bein' up all night praying she'd say, ""Yes""

So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death
My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me, and I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it

Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends
And that apartment got smaller everyday

Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, she said, ""Where have you been
You used to call and tell me you're on your way""
She said, ""If this is how it's gonna be then I quit""
She walked out the door, I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it

I picked myself up off the floor
She walked back through the door
We made love like it was the first time

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like a curse that is the cure
Better or worse, one thing's for sure
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do if I lost it

Oh if I lost it
(If I lost it)
I don't wanna lose it"

Eve,Love Is Blind,"Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you

She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?

I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him

I thought you was a doctor, be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, baby girl you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said
Your seed was growin' from his semen

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your ass and you ain't givin' no help

Uh-huh big time hustler, snake motherfucker
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your kids?
How could you tell her that you lover her?

Don't give a fuck if she lives
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missin' your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress

Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Floss like you possess her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead

Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up

You heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga, I'm ma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets, never

Cops comin' in, watch me goin' to jail
Nigga whatever my bitch, fuck it my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find"

We said that no one ever would get between us
So love will never ever leave us
That was a while ago, oh

But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like, all we do is fight
Every single night can't make it tight
Can't get it right, I just wanna go back

Take it way back, all the way back
Can we start again? Do it over?
Can we straighten' it out?
Can we work it out? 'Cause

I don't wanna be

Where did we go wrong?
We both made mistakes
We gotta carry on

"Montgomery, John Michael",The Little Girl,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His name never read her His word
Two non-believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out

And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life

And some people from the city
Took the girl far away
To a new mom and a new dad
Kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, â€½I know that Man up there on that cross
I don't know His name but I know He got offâ€

'Cause He was there in my old house
He held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch
The night that my parents died"
"Carter, Aaron",Aaron's Party (Come Get It),"Here's a little bit old school for ya
That goes a little something like this...

I always try to be the flyest kid on the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(throw the party of the month?)
nah the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I got to do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie (no, send them to a show)
let me think hmmm, it's gotta be long though
I said mom and dad yo, why you sitting home
It's a friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about staying out to long
Don't fuss over me,
I'll be fine alone (*car leaving*, beep beep)
Have a good time
The doorbell rings, cause the party's here
I am cranking up the stereo like it's new years
Walking round' the house like who's
the man
Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can
(First on the floor)
you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's mtv
I guess I'll wear a thong, I lost my head!
I jumped on the table and this is what I said

CHORUS

Everyone together sing it loud

Things are going great then to my surprise
Some people walked in I didn't reconize
I said fellas yo you gotta get out
(Hey man, I thought this was an open house)
Open house? (yeah, that's what the flyers said)
I didn't put out flyers (Well, somebody did)
Then walked in the girl I am crushing
Then the kid spilled juice on my mom's new cushions
I turned around another kid broke a lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)They got them in France
But for now I won't sweat it, I'll clean it up later
There's a hunny over there and I really want to meet her

CHORUS
People all around you got to
(come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it)

Break it down (go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
(now the real trouble starts)
is that the car door? oh dang, I am in trouble
Everyone get out now on the double
I am dead (your done)
That's it for me
I am gonna be picked off my family tree,
once mom finds out bout' this party I had
I don't even want to start thinking of my dad
I am husseling around the house trying to clean the mess
I sure to put my new white nikes to the test
The car door slams as their walking up the steps
I guess life was good, there's 10 seconds left...

"Vassar, Phil",Just Another Day In Paradise,"The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?

Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back

There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's okay, it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
I guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise

Well, plan B looks like
Dominoes' pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue

But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy
Me and my teddy
Come in to sleep in between

Yeah it's okay it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

But if you think we high, nigga think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim, you got to think to win

Everybody will know it 'cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the lord that I don't pull out, cuss out and bust out
Go to nigga raveling, make the clip traveling, uh

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great

Pockets on flood shit, OG lyrical blood shit

You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting 'cause I had the wife whooping

I come from padres gold in oversized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it, don't stop till I get it

Oh, what a pain I've got,
it must be love!
There's nothing I can do,
all that I want is you.
Look what I'm going through,
it must be love!

It must be love, it must be love.
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove.
You must be the dream I been dreaming of,
oh what a feeling, it must be love!

Something is wrong or right,
I think of you all night.
Can't sleep 'til morning light,
It must be love!

Seeing you in my dreams,
holding you close to me.
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love!

It must be love, it must be love.
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove.
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love.

"Griggs, Andy",She's More,"I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned

Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I pictured at all
In those paint by number fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the woman I was born to love

Her laughter fills my soul
And when I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her I can't get enough

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves
I couldn't ask for more
Than a love like hers

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more"
No Doubt,Simple Kind Of Life,"For a long time I was in love
Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be the wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all love
You came along, I'm hunting you down

Oh, like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

Oh, if we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought, I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
You seem like you'd be a good dad

Now all those simple things are simply too
Complicated for my life
And how'd I get so faithful to my freedom
A selfish kind of life

When all I ever wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
A simple kind of life
A simple kind of life

Vitamin C,Graduation (Friends Forever),"So we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
I keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)

But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out 'cause we're on a different track and if you
Got something that you need to say, you better say it right now
'Cause you don't have another day (Another day)

'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound and I
Keep thinking of the night in June, I didn't know much of love
But it came too soon (Oh, came too soon)

And there was me and you and then it got real blue
Stay at home talking on the telephone and we would
Get so excited and we'd get so scared, laughing at ourselves
Thinking life's not fair, (Ooh) and this is how it feels (Ooh-Ooh)

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together

And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school?
Still be tryna break every single rule? (Every rule)

Will Little Brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep
Keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Not goodbye), keep on thinking
It's a time to fly, (Ooh) and this is how it feels (Ooh-Ooh)

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together

And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La
We will still be, friends forever

Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? (Somehow?)
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men

Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town? I keep
Keep thinking that it's not goodbye (It's not goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

As we go on (Ooh)
We remember (We remember)
All the times we (We)
Had together (Together, Love)

And as our lives change (Yeah)
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (We will always)
Friends forever (Friends forever)

As we go on (As we go on)
We remember (Yeah)
All the times we (Yay-Yeah)
Had together (Ooh-Ooh-Ooh)

And as our lives change (Ooh-Ooh)
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (Yay-Yeah)

"Gilman, Billy",One Voice,"Some kids have and some kids don't
And some of us are wondering why
And Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff that's making her cry

We need some help
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

A house, a yard, a neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kind of world where Mom and Dad
Still believe the golden rule

Life's not that simple
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

One voice, one simple word
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
Keep believing till you find a way

Yesterday while walking home
I saw some kid on Newbury road
He pulled a pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below

Thanks for the help
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard"
Lonestar,Smile,"I still remember the night we met
You said you loved my smile
But your love for me was like a summer breeze
Oh, it lasted for a while

I could hold on a little tighter I know
But when you love someone you gotta let 'em go

So I'm gonna smile
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
An' even if it kills me, I'm gonna smile

Kiss me once for them good times, baby
Kiss me twice for goodbye
You can't help how you don't feel
And it doesn't matter why

Give me a chance to bow out gracefully
'Cause that's how I want you to remember me

I'm gonna smile
'Cause I wanna make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
An' even if it kills me, I'm gonna smile

I'm gonna smile
So you can find the courage
Laugh, so you won't see me hurtin'
I'm gonna let you go in style
An' even if it kills me, I'm gonna smile"
"Rogers, Kenny",Buy Me A Rose,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
Three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

""Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life""

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if, she'd say

""Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life""

And the more that he lives, the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives, the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
'Cause, I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life, rest of your life

And I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life"
"Lawrence, Tracy",Lessons Learned,"I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
As daddy showed me wrong from right

He said, â€½This hurts me more than it does you
There's just some things son, that you just don't do
Is anything I'm sayin' getting throughâ€
â€½But daddy I can see the lightâ€

Oh lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it
'Cause this world turns on lessons learned

Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his truck
Circling that old town square

He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
But I never heard him 'cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there

Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it
'Cause this world turns on lessons learned

Oh, lessons learned, man they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap

"Strait, George",Go On,"I'm so sorry, I keep interrupting, what were you gonna say?
You caught him cheatin', I don't blame you for walkin' away
I know where you're comin' from, it sounds like where I've been
Oh there I go interrupting your story once again

Go on, go on
You were sayin' 'How a fool can only fool you so long'
It's true, it's so true
When they do you like that, what else can you do but go on

Our conversation won't change nothin' but it's sure nice to talk
With somebody who's been cut out of the same ol' cloth
You know how you said happiness can't be found lookin' back
If you don't mind, maybe we can talk a little more about that

Go on, go on
You were sayin' this is better than sittin' at home
It's true, it's so true
When they do you like that what else can you do but go?

On even when you see no reason to
Don't wait to live life 'cause it won't wait for you

Go on, please go on
You were sayin', ""What don't kill us only makes us strong""
It's true, that's so true
When they do you like that what else can you do but go on?

"Walker, Clay",The Chain Of Love,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way my name is Joe
She said I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must have seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said how much do I owe you
Here's what he had to say

You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you

Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet
And though she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinkin' about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
Everything's gonna be alright, I love you, Joe"
"McBride, Martina",Love's The Only House,"I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said, ""Don't you know that more is less""

She said, ""This world is moving so fast
But I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way""
All I could say was

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

He was walking by the other day and I said
""Hey baby, how you been?""
Yeah, I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin

And you only want what you can't have
And baby, you can't have me now, I gave me heart to another
Yeah, I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family
And we've got each other and I found out the hard way that

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives with drugs and pain to spare

And here I am in my clean, white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walkin' around in a culture of darkness
Livin' together alone, all I can say is

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playin' out of tune
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
And senorita can't quit cryin', baby's due now any day
Don Juan left, got sick of tryin', no one there to show him the way

She came down to the grocery store
And she said ""I, I wanna buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money""
I said ""Hey, I'll cover you honey 'cause the pain's gotta go somewhere""
Yeah, the pain's gotta go someplace, so come on down to my house

Don't you know that
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

Don't you know that
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain"

"Tippin, Aaron",Kiss This,"She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down

She had just about succeeded
When the low-down, no-good, cheating, good-for-nothing
Came strutting through the crowd

Oh, he was laying it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his never ending love

Oh but I never will forget when she stood up and said
So, I guess you think, we're gonna kiss and make up, don't you
That's when she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Hey me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do

You just come on over here
One last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye

Well, the next thing I recall
She had him backed against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone

She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

It was just about now
That the crowd gathered around
They'd come to watch him pay for his every sin

She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She reared back and she let him have it again, man
She said, she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Hey me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do

You just come on over here

Pucker up and close your eyes

"Jackson, Alan",Pop A Top,"Pop a top, again.
I just got time for one more round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone;
And you can let some other fool sit down.

I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away.
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place.
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

Pop a top, again.
I think I'll have another round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.

Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind.
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer.
So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her.

Pop a top, again.
I think I'll have another round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.
Pop a top, again."
"Black, Clint",Been There,"Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
And wonder where you were
You need the one and only that can hold you tight
And you reach for her, but she's not with you
You just wish this trip would end
Well you know I've been there, I don't wanna go back again

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
And wonder who you are?
You suddenly discover there's a price you pay
For gettin' this far, and it's the part of you
You really don't have to spend
You know I've been there, and I don't wanna go back again

There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no

Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream
That didn't come true
You think you're gotta give up on makin' that scene
And seeing it through, you feel like breaking
When you really just need to bend
You know I've been there, and I'll never go back again

There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream"
Common,The Light,"Yeah
Doo doo doo, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Doo doo doo, diggy-doo yo

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree"
"Vassar, Phil",Carlene,"I was lousy at math, a failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was quarterback in the back of the class
She was the whiz kid in the horned-rim glasses
It'd been a long time since I'd been around
Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says
""I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever""
It took a second to put it all together, I said

Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene
Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

She said ""Hop in, let's go for a spin
Tell me what you been doing boy and where you've been""
I said ""I write songs, you probably didn't know
and I finally got a couple out on country radio""
She said ""What a switch, ain't life funny
I've got a PhD, now I'm modeling for money
Imagine Little Miss 4.0
Just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue""
I said ""You've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without reservation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations""

Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene
Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

I said ""I hope to see you again someday""
She said ""Another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my mama's at eight,"" I said

Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene
Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean
Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene
Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean"
"Jackson, Alan",www.memory,"I know you're leavin', I see the signs
You're gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me, you'll never write
You made your mind up and you're gone tonight
If some rainy day you're all alone
You feel like talkin', you can log me on
At www dot memory
Ill be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me
At www dot memory
You won't even have to hold me or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me through your keyboard and wires
Though you won't have to touch me or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around until you see it land

I'll be waitin' for you patiently
If you feel the need just click on me

I had a friend
Very deeply
Love lived within
But somehow we got loose
From what was oh so tight
Somewhere we went wrong
When we were oh so right

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end

If we can't be friends

I'm emotional

I am trying to hold on to you
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

You seem to hurt me purposely
I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me?
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more

But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway

And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u

and said ok

a year ago today
hangin onto pride and anger
as we threw our love away

"John, Elton",Someday Out Of The Blue,"Some day out of the blue
In a crowded street or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you as if our love were new
Some day we can start again, some day soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields

Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all and watched it slip away
Where are we now?

Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you

As if we always knew
Some day we would live again, some day soon

I still believe
I still put faith in us"
Pearl Jam,Nothing As It Seems,"Pearl Jam
Binaural
Nothing As It Seems
Don't feel like home. He's a little out.
And all these words elope. It's nothing like your poem.
Putting in. Inputting in. Don't feel like methadone.
A scratching voice all alone it's nothing like your baritone.

It's nothing as it seems. The little that he needs. It's home.
The little that he sees. Is nothing he concedes. It's home.

One uninvited chromosome. A blanket like the ozone.

It's nothing as it seems. All that he needs. It's home.
The little that he frees is nothing he believes.

Saving up a sunny day. Something maybe two tone.
Anything of his own. A chip off the corner stone.
Who's kidding? Rainy day. A one way ticket headstone.
Occupations overthrown. A whisper through a megaphone.

It's nothing as it seems. The little that he needs. It's home.
The little that he sees is nothing he concedes. It's home.
And all that he frees. A little bittersweet. It's home.
It's nothing as it seems. The little that you see it's home"

The Best Of Me
[Jadakiss](Mya) 
Uh, huh 
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha (whoa) 
Yo, yo 

[Mya](Jadakiss) 
You put me on 
I can't let, (nah, yeah) let him go no 
(I just wanna do what's best for you) 
Can't let you get, oh no (Yo, yo) 

He has a little game that he plays 
Clever little ways and a hot boy style 
Racks up on the dough that he makes 
Flash a little cash watch girls wild out 
Lately he's been checking for me 
Telling me how much he wants to be 
Wants to be the one to replace 
Replace the man that waits at home for me 

1 - But oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me 
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see 
How you flow out them clothes 
Then you put it on me 
Feelings coming on strong 
I know that it's wrong 
I can't let you get the best of me 

(You put it on me) 
The best of me 
(You put it on me) 

So busy trying to play with my head 
Telling me how he could blow my mind 
Something about the things that he said 
Made me want to take it there one time 
I should be walking away 
Cause his hands up on my thigh 
Should I leave, should I stay? 
After all it's just one night 

Repeat 1 

(You put it on me) 
The best of me 
(You put it on me) 

[Jadakiss] 
Yo, yo, yo I got so many bags of money 
That they won't fit in the bank 
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank 
But I'mma make sure both y'all win 
Let him keep the place you move 
And I'mma pay both y'alls rent 
So forget about the condo and come to the crib 
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge 
You know literally we can go shopping in Italy 
Hand on her thigh she don't wanna get rid of me 
And she don't drink or know how a L look 
Chanel look mixed with the Pete Arnell look 
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city 
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me 
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty we living it up 
I put it on your ass if you giving up 
And you know I'm not a hater 
And if you feel bad then you can call him later 
And tell him you all Jada's 

[Mya] 
Oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me 
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see 
How you flow out them clothes 
Then you put it on me 
You ain't gonna get to me 
You can't get the best of me 

Repeat 1 

Oh no I can't let you 
Get the best of me 
Even though deep inside 
Something's dying to see 
How you flow out them clothes 
Then you put it on me 
Oh yeah, oh..."
"Heatherly, Eric",Flowers On The Wall,"I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
All that thought you've given me is, conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me
I'm havin' lots of fun

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream, it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here, havin' quite a time

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do

It's good to see you, I must go I know I look a fright
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do
Don't tell me, I've nothin' to do"
Eminem,Stan,"My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam

I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man

He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said ""No""
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?

You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the air in the night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him

That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now

I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me

See Slim, ""Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk""
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too

Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin''
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little

I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was you! Damn!"
"McEntire, Reba",I'll Be,"When darkness falls upon your heart and soul
I'll be the light that shines for you
When you forget, how beautiful you are
I'll be there to remind you
When you can't find your way
I'll find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you

I'll be your shoulder
When you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you, I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain fallin' down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

And when you're there, with no one there to hold
I'll be the arms, that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
I'll be there to believe in you
When all you find are lies
I'll be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me

I'll be your shoulder
When you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you, I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain fallin' down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

I'll be the sun
When your hearts filled with rain
I'll be the one
To chase the rain away

I'll be your shoulder
When you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you, I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you

"Lopez, Jennifer",Feelin' Good,"We got artist of the year rhyming here
Grammy nominations and platinum plus
Ain't nothing, baby, all I want in life
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

You priceless, you like diamonds and icey wrists
We got chedda, I'm twice as rich
Make you bite your lips, Jenny, you know you like unless
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists
Treat you like a bitch, never that

We got beef where my niggaz at
Streets is where I'm living at

Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack
Where we at, uptown where it's really at
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop
Let my hands slip a knot

Joe you the don, Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way

I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of my fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no

Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life and tonight's for feeling

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your man off
He's just trying to get your pants off

That's the last straw, Pun, I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother
There's to things I don't share
That's my money and my mother

I love honeys since the paradise for real
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real
Shut up your grill, you know we never fight
It's your world, girl, set it off right

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

I'm feelin' so, party every night
Everything is feelin' right
I'm feelin' so, party every night
Everything is feelin' right
The world's gonna treat me right

I'm feeling so good, I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should

"Urban, Keith",Your Everything,"The first time I looked in your eyes, I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face, I felt
What I've never felt with anyone else

I want to give back what you've givin' to me
I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more then just your man

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes

Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more
I wanna be your everything

When you wake up, I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out for me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
And I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes

Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more
I wanna be your everything

I'll be the wheels that never rust
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more

I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything"

Over and over I look in your eyes
You are all I desire, you have captured me
I want to hold you, I want to be close to you
I never want to let go
I wish that this night would never end
I need to know

Could I hold you for a lifetime
Could I look into your eyes
Could I have this night to share this night together
Could I hold you close beside me
Could I hold you for all time
Could I, could I have this kiss forever
Could I, could I have this kiss forever

Over and over I've dreamed of this night
Now you're here by my side, you are next to me
I want to hold you and touch you and taste you
And make you want no one but me
I wish that this kiss could never end, no no
Oh baby, please

Could I hold you for a lifetime
Could I look into your eyes
Could I have this night to share this night together
Could I hold you close beside me
Could I hold you for all time
Could I, could I have this kiss forever
Could I, could I have this kiss forever

I don't want any night to go by
Without you by my side
I just want all my days
Spent being next to you
Lived for just loving you
And baby, oh by the way

Could I hold you for a lifetime
Could I look into your eyes
Could I have this night to share this night together
Could I hold you close beside me
Could I hold you for all time

Sweat baby sweat baby sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes I'm Siskel, yes I'm Hebert and you're getting two thumbs up

You've had enough of two hand touch
You want it rough you're out of bounds
I want you smothered want you covered

Come quicker than Fed-Ex never reach an apex
Just like Coca Cola stock
You are inclined to make me rise an hour early
Just like daylight savings time

So if I capsize on your thighs

"Williams, Robbie",Angels,"I sit and wait
Does an angel
Contemplate my fate?
Do they know
The places where we go
When we're gray and old
'Cause I've been told
That salvation
Lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lyin' in my bed
Thoughts runnin' through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

When I'm feelin' weak
And my pain walks down
A one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
An' when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

When I come to call
She won't forsake me

That I wish I didn't do
Now I do the things I do

I believe in the message of a dream
And I believe in what you are

I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Well her Daddy said, ""Child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sure don't like me""
Momma just says ""Y'all have a little fun""
Said, ""Ain't doin' nothing me and papa ain't done""

Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss as I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

I'm a hayseed and a plow boy
I'm a farm kid and a cowboy, I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too

I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Yeah it's true I run around with hillbilly girls
The weekend sits on my hillbilly world
You better be ready when the sun goes down
'Cause that's when country comes to town, here I come"

Dreaming all day
Of holding you
Touching you

The only thing I want to do
Is be with you
As close to you
As I can be

Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Oh, baby

Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you

I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes
Let's get lost tonight
In each other

Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I want to feel you in my soul

Last year, Valentine's day
You would spoil me and say
""Babe, I love you, love you (Yo, he's lying) and I swear""
Held you when you were sick, even... (sucked yo dick)
The whole time I think to myself, this isn't fair

What is this I see (No)
You don't come home to me (Oh, no)
When you don't come home to me (Man)
Can't deal, can't bear

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat
And you're (Bitch) caught out there

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ahhhhh...
I hate you so much right now

So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up, (ha - ha - ha) tell me
How you gonna see it now
So far from sincere (I love you)
Fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall
I come slidin' down

What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy
Since you're caught out there

(Yeah, you've been caught)
Yo', come on
Come on

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah
I hate you so much right now

(She's so)
Raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
Look, she dresses (Look at her)
A mess, what do you see (I don't know)
It's not all about cash (Hell, no)
Not how much you flash
How I dress is a reflection of me

What is this I see
You don't come home to me (Uh - uh)
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)

You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I got somethin' for y'all
Since you're caught out there

I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

Ooh, you so nasty, amateur pole dancin'
Come and get this cash from me, they call me 'Rain Man'
She tried to rain dance, money so long, it will drown you, girl
Buried under so much stacks, they had to pull back
About 50 thou before they found you, girl

I brought book bags of that bankroll
I'm a D boy, baby, they know
I'm an original D boy
They go bankrupt if they try to keep up

No roof on my car
But I got mirrors on the ceiling
I'll spread bread on the bed
Ever had sex on a million? Tell me

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl

Red light, TLC, through the Left Eye, my P.O.V.
On the eye chat, how's that for computer love?
She rolled her eyes back, I'm like, â€½Ooh, you so nastyâ€
You turned my Maybach back seat  into the Hotel de Paris

I ain't gotta go down to the go-go
You got a private show, that's like magic city
I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds
That's role play, act like you want it

You know, you know, you hot like fire
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1's and not the 5's
Have you ever seen us go to Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know you hot

Girl, I like it when you bounce, bounce

I bet you know, you know you hot like fire
As I blow this dough, you might, could retire
Take it slow like Neo when shots was fired
In the Matrix, have patience got lots of bottles

Rock-a-bye baby, Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1's, got no 5's, my D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
Like Nicole Richie, roll with me, they on the diet, baby

Anything you want, girl
I bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor, girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

3 Doors Down,Loser,"Breathe in right away
Nothing seems to fill this place
I need this every time
Take your lies, get off my case

Some day I will find
A love that flows through me like this
And this will fall away
This will fall away

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead

You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser
I'm a loser, yeah

This is getting old
I can't break these chains that I hold
My body's growing cold
There's nothing left of this mind or my soul

Addiction needs a pacifier
The buzz of this poison is taking me higher
And this will fall away
This will fall away

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead

You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser
Well I'm a loser

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead

You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead

You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser"
Brooks & Dunn,You'll Always Be Loved By Me,"I know forever is a long long time
For a girl to put her heart on the line
Trust is a tight rope we all have to walk
Baby, don't be afraid I won't let you fall

With a little faith mountains move
You and me, we can't lose

You can count on the sun to rise
And the stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me

Love comes, so many times goes
So much out there we'll never know
Call it fate, call it destiny
But I think we were meant to be

This old world it spins so fast
So many things they just don't last

You can count on the sun to rise
And the stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me

You can count on the sun to rise
And the stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me
You'll always be loved by me"
"Chesney, Kenny",What I Need To Do,"I keep tellin' myself, this is the right thing to do
I was wastin' her time, waitin' on dreams that just weren't comin' true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leadin' me on to somewhere, that no one knows my name

I've got the window rolled down
I've got the radio up
I'm doin' all I can
To get my mind off us

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on and on and on

Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep

Now the sun's goin' down
On my broken heart
Lord, I gotta get back
Before I go too far

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, yes I drive on and on and on

Knowin' what I need to do
Girl, I'm comin' home to you
Knowin' what I need to do
Girl, I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you
Knowin' what I need to do"

""Broken spirit, lost and confused
Empty, scared, used and abused, a fool""

Shows on your face

Remember my love, it's only a thin line
It's never too late

Papa Roach,Last Resort,"Cut my life into pieces

Suffocation, no, no breathing

This is my last resort

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding

Would it be wrong or
Would it be right
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

I never realized, I was spread too thin
Till it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin

It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searching to find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying I'm crying
I can't go on living this way

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no, no breathing
Don't give a fuck
If I cut my arm bleeding

Would it be wrong
Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Can't go on, living this way
Nothing's all right"

I bang and let your fuckin' brains hang, snitches
Fuck Marla Maple bitches with riches

Who carry 22's, up in they hosiery
A black teller when my father bust and unloaded me
Think he just finished sniffin' a KI, and dippin' the D's
Don't hate me, hate Nicky Barnes for hittin' my moms

Letting the condom pop, nigga I was born in the drop
Coke boil in the pot, shake the Feds
And bust shots at them street cops
Fuck yo' point is?

My point is double fours at your fuckin' jaws
Pointed, hollow point shit
Four-point-six, need I say more?
Or do you get the point bitch? C'mon

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? Bad Boyz
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot

Minks draggin' on the floor, bangin' on your whore
Suckin' the croissant just examine it for flaws
Pour the Cristal on the way to trial, RICO law
Got a nigga head hurtin' squirtin' 'til they pull the curtain

Let the money drip dry, hundred dollar bills
Wipe the tears from my eyes, no love
Fuck y'all niggaz, hope you die a slow death
As I coke-test and C. DeLores Tucker protest

Can't fuck with you weak rap niggaz, witcha gay raps
Runnin' 'round talkin' this and talkin' that
See me in the streets, tried to give me dap
Andrew Cunanan ass niggaz, my two cannons blast niggaz, ass niggaz

Got me fucked up in the game, get your shirt stained
Keep your five mics nigga, give me the 'caine
Do the shit to clean my money dummies, gleamed the wrist out
Cop the pistal, nigga, talk shit now, uh

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? Bad Boyz
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot

Bling bling, it's a Bad Boy thing
Bullets heat-seekin', streep sweepin', with an evil grin
Watch you die, one love, one life, one Shyne
Y'all niggaz ain't sayin' nothin', like a mime

Every line, I live it, I write it with a pencil so niggaz die
Of lead poison if they bite it, hate it but recite it
It's a G thang, me and Puff in St. Bart's set it off
Bitches walkin' topless with G-strings, menage'

Bust shots at your crew, another charge
As the gulf stream fly through the fog, make ya popular
Pockets filled with more high notes than the opera
Franklins on top of the, Jacksons, my nigga Ty leave you tired
Bad Boy, repsect it or die, coward

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? Bad Boyz
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? Bad Boyz
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot

R.E.M.,The Great Beyond,"I've watched the stars fall silent from your eyes
All the sights that I have seen
I can't believe that I believed
I wished that you could see
There's a new planet in the solar system
There is nothing up my sleeve

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

In all this talk of time, talk is fine
But I don't want to stay around
Why can't we pantomime
Just close our eyes
And sleep sweet dreams
Me and you with wings on our feet

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great beyond

I want the humming birds, the dancing bears
Sweetest dreams of you
I look into the stars
I look into the moon

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great beyond

I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great
Answers from the great, answers

I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great beyond
I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great
Answers from the great, answers
I'm breaking through
I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great beyond"
"Diffie, Joe",It's Always Somethin',"Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by
What else can I do, I wonder if it's you
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin'
Is like a soundtrack to the love we had

I should be over you by now
But every time I turn around

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart

What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something

Lunch time, a new place, waitress says her name
Why does it have to be, Emily
Corner store, stop in, someone ask, ""How ya been?""
I say, ""I wouldn't know, I really gotta go""

Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how
'Cause every time I turn around

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart

What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing

But it's always something every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart

What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something, it's always something
Oh it's always something, it's always something"
"McGraw, Tim",Some Things Never Change,"After all this time, I still miss you everyday
The same world spins round
I guess some things never change

Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby, some things never change

When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song

Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

Maybe someday, someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on

Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby, some things never change

Girl, I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change

I still love you
I guess some things never change"
"Henley, Don",Taking You Home,"I had a good life
Before you came
I had my friends and my freedom
I had my name

Still there was sorrow and emptiness
Till you made me glad
Oh, in this love
I found strength never knew I had

And this love is like nothing have ever known
Take my hand love
I'm taking you home, taking you home

There were days, lonely days
When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb
No no, but I kept on believing
That this day would come

And this love is like nothing I have ever known
No no baby, take my hand love
I'm taking you home, I'm taking you home

Where we can be with the ones
Who really care
Home, where we can grow together
Keep you in my heart forever

Oh, and this love is like nothing I have ever known
Oh, no no baby, take my hand love
I'm taking you home

Oh, this love is like nothing I have ever known
No no baby, take my hand
Taking you home, I'm taking you home, yes I am

Taking you home
Taking you home
Taking you home
Taking you home"
Eminem,The Way I Am,"Whatever, Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
(Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
(Speak to me)

I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
(Is on empty)

No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
(Liftin' you 10 feet)
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
(Of all you)
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
(On Marilyn)

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now, it's a tragedy
Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin'
(This happenin')

Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
(Rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is""

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am"

Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cock feel it

It's real in the field, the Last Mohegan
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Leg it now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge

Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious, Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow, Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler

To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Shorty, say what's your price

The shackles on your feet
(You owe nas)
I think you owe me some
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something

I said, ""Shorty, say what's your price""

Miscellaneous
Best Friend
[Puffy] (Mario) 
I've seen a lot of things in my life 
Alot of ups and downs 
Made alot of mistakes 
No matter what, you've always been by my side 
You've always been my best friend 
You're the love of my life (Oh) 
You're everything to me (Oh) 
You never left my side (You're my best friend) 
I love you so much (Yes, you are) 
You're my best friend 

[Puffy] 
Since the beginning of time 
All you did was bless men 
Too young to understand but now you my best friend 
How could they doubt you, never think about you 
Don't they know nothing's possible without you 

Faith without fear that's how they raised me 
Words of man kill but never phase me 
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me 
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me? 
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living 
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in 
Gotta be more than just to lust women 
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen 
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due 
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew 
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through 
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord 

1 - [Mario Winans] 
Lord, you mean the world to me 
Before I was born you chose me 
You always hear me when I'm calling 
Even catch me when I'm falling 
You're the closest one to me 
I surrender all to thee 
I want the whole wide world to see 
That we've always been and we'll always be 
Best friends 

[Puffy] 
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far 
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star 
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight 
Then give it to you and let it shine bright 
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth 
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit 
Can't you see that He spread love for you 
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you 
Willies with mac millies know how you get down 
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town 
Just remember when you pray, God is love 
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs 
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him 
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him 
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him 
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him 

Repeat 1 

[Puffy] 
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed 
Been two and a half years since my world crashed 
I needed help, God gave me the power 
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour 
Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?"" 
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me 
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out 
Never wavered once, gave me no way out 
Your time to die, don't even stress the date 
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take 
I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith"" 
""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great"" 
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering 
Ground started to shake, everything trembling 
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands 
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on 

Repeat 1 While: 

[Puffy] 
You mean everything to me 
You've been with me from day one 
Even when I thought nobody was there 
You were there 
You're my best friend 
I love you like no other 
There is no feeling like this in the world 
If you can relate to what I'm feeling 
Put your hands in the air for me 
Let me see you 
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me 
Clap your hands, come on 
Thank you Jesus 
You always hear me when I'm calling 
Always catch me when I fall, yeah 
I surrender all to thee 
I want the whole world to see 
That you've always been, you'll always be 
My best friend 
I love you Jesus 
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses 
As I forgive those who trespass against me 
Thank you"
"McBride, Martina",There You Are,"There you are in the early light of day
There you are in the quiet words I pray
I've been blessed by the simple happiness
Of the perfect love we've made

Every time I turn around
When I'm lost and when I'm found
Like an angel standing guard
There you are

Every time I take a breath
And when I forget to breathe
You're watching over me
There you are

When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are

There you are standing in a crowded room
There you are the earth and I'm the moon
My desire is to stand by the fire
That burns inside of you

Every time I turn around
When I'm lost and when I'm found
Like an angel standing guard
There you are

Every time I take a breath
And when I forget to breathe
You're watching over me
There you are

When I'm looking for the light
In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are

In the middle of the night
Searching for the brightest star
There you are, there you are

Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'mma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dikes on ninja bikes

No matter what people say
We got it going on

(Won't you come and)

I'm just trying to be me
Doing what I got to do
So why y'all keep hating on me and my crew

Yo I'm saying Q.B
Look at them and look at you

If I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different a dude and other crews
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade
(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)
Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you went and copped the bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it
My fam deep with security in the jeep
When the Queen come in town everything shut down

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think

(Come and show me how you do that baby)
No matter what people say

I'm the highest, your highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin so that 'ju know
*Rakim* ""This is how it should be done
Cause this style, is indentical to none""
The hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop
To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin on me
Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind
In fact I'ma give it to y'all one more time like

Uh yeah, what?

LFO,I Don't Wanna Kiss You Goodnight,"I can't believe the night is gone,
Now its time to take you home.
Girl, as you come in close to give me one last kiss
You're making it hard to be so me,
Don't want to leave you like this no, Cause...

I don't want to kiss you good-night,
If a kiss means this night is over
I don't want to have to say good bye no, no, no
Girl, don't leave me standing at your door.
When this night could lead to so much more...
I wanna hold you (hold you)
I wanna touch you(touch you)
Don't want to kiss you,
Don't want to kiss you goodnight,

I used to see you in my dreams,
(Hoping one day they'd come true)And then you gave
yourself to me, But now we're standing here and
I'm holding you, And this never felt so right.
Don't want to leave you here, Can I come inside, And
kiss you where you like?????

Baby feeling your skin on my skin,
I'd take my time to make you breathless
Girl, we can do it again and again..."

Where You Are

There are times 
I swear I know you're here 
When I forget about my fears 
Feeling you my dear 
Watchin over me 
And my hope seeks 
What the future will bring 
When you wrap me in your wings 
And take me: 

[Chorus]

Where you are 
Where you and I will breathe together 
Once again 
We'll be dancing in the moonlight 
Just like we used to do 
And you'll be smilin back at me 
Only then will I be free 
When I can be 
Where you are 

And I can see your face 
Your kiss I still can taste 
Not a memory erased 
Oh, I see your star 
Shining down on me 
And I'd do anything 
If I could just 
Be right there: 

[CHORUS]

Then I will be free 
So take me where you are 
Now baby there were times when selfishly 
I'm wishing that you are here with me 
So I can wipe the tears away from your eyes 
And make you see 
That every night while you are dreamin 
I'm here to guard you from a far 
And anytime I feel alone 
I close my eyes and just be there: 
Where you are 
Where you and I can breathe together 
(and we will breathe together baby) 
Once again (oh, we'll be dancing in the moonlight) 
We'll be dancin in the moonlight 
Just like we used to be 
And you'll be smilin back at me 
(only then will I be free) 
Then I will be free 
Baby I still believe 
Oh I've got to believe 
I will touch you that sweet day 
That you take me there Where you are 
I still believe 
Oh I've got to believe 
I will touch you that sweet day 
That you take me there 
Where you are 
Oh where you are 
I've got to believe 
I'll always be waiting here 
That sweet day yeah 
Only wanna be where you are

Show me what I wanna see
Mirror, mirror, lie to me

Why don't I like the girl I see?
The one that's standing right in front of me
Why don't I think before I speak?
I should have listened to that voice inside me

I must be stupid
Must be crazy
Must be out of my mind
To say the kind of things I said last night

Mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back to me

Mirror, mirror,lie to me
Show me what I wanna see, to me
Mirror, mirror, lie to me
Show me what I wanna see

Why did I let you walk away?
When all I had to do was say I'm sorry
I let my pride get in the way, the way
And in the heat of the moment I was to blame

I must be stupid
Must be crazy
Must be out of my mind
Now in the cold light of the day I realize

Mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back to me

If only wishes could be dreams
And all my dreams could come true
There would be two of us standing here in front of you
If you could show me that someone that I used to be
Bring back my baby, my baby, my baby to me

Mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all
Mirror, mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back

Mirror, mirror hanging on the wall
You don't have to tell me
Who's the biggest fool of all

And bring my baby back
Bring my baby back, baby back, baby back to me

Quit trying to play me for a fool 

Girl you know that you are wrong 
You're here one minute and the next you're gone 
I'm not blind baby I can see 
So why don't you admit 
You don't love me 

You call me on the phone 
Sayin' you'll be late coming home 
You say your boss is making you work late 
But I don't believe it 
Cause when I called your office 
So that I could speak with you 
You know what they told me 
They told me that you quit last week 

And how can you explain 
That when we make love 
You're calling out somebody else's name 
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide 
And they can't hide what you feel inside baby

But you were with another man 
I couldn't believe it 
So I asked your friends 
Who the hell was he 
You know what they told me 
It was a guy that you met last week 

And now I can explain 
Why when we make love 
You're calling out somebody else's name 
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide 
And they can't hide what you feel inside baby

Joe,Treat Her Like A Lady,"Something ain't right, something just ain't right
Lord have mercy, babe
Tell me when was the last time, you brought her roses home from work
Tell me when was the last time, you rubbed her feet when she said they hurt
Tell me when was the last time, you bought a card to tell her how you feel
Don't even know when was the last time, you lit a candle for a late night meal
Tell me

How long will it be before you treat her like your queen
And how long will it take, before she starts coming home too late
And how long will it be, before she starts running in the streets
You better the time to treat her like your lady

You probably don't know when was the last time
You stopped to open her car door
And tell me when was the last time, you heard her say, baby do it once more
Tell me when was the last time, you didn't have an argument
Don't even know when was the last time, you told the truth about where you been
Now if this don't apply to you (if this don't apply to you)
Keep doing what you do (keep doing what you do)
But if this shoe fits you well, take a minute just to ask yourself (just 60 seconds now)

How long will it be before you treat her like your queen
And how long will it take, before she starts coming home too late
And how long will it be, before she starts running in the streets
You better the time to treat her like your lady

Now see what's old to you, is just like new to the next man
What you don't do for her, she'll find somebody else who can
If you don't wanna lose out on the best thing you ever had
You better take it from me, you'll only end up just a lonely man
See I know what I'm talking about

How long will it be before you treat her like your queen
And how long will it take, before she starts coming home too late
And how long will it be, before she starts running in the streets
You better the time to treat her like your lady

(You better run to her)

How long will it be before you treat her like your queen
And how long will it take, before she starts coming home too late
And how long will it be, before she starts running in the streets
You better the time to treat her like your lady"
"Blige, Mary J.",Deep Inside,"Yeah yeah
Oh oh

The problem is, for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I rarely trust

And every time I find someone I like
Gotta worry about if it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, oh

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me
'Cause they're looking for a ride that's free

So I made the choice to be
Good to those who were good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil God's allowed me to see
I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Mary

It's the car I drive, the clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman

So I need someone to stand by me
And supply my needs
And I'm just plain old Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary

"Price, Kelly",You Should've Told Me,"I wouldn't call in the midnight hour
I wouldn't tuck you in and turn the nightlight out
You would walk through the door and I wouldn't say, ""Hi""
I would walk out the door and wouldn't say, ""Bye-bye""

It's funny that I never thought about it that way
I never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world, thinking I'm a perfect lady

You should've told me, I wasn't small enough
You should've told me, I didn't call enough
But you led me on and kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time

You should've told me, I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me, I didn't smile enough
What you had in mind made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

I wasn't there to help you take your clothes off
When it was time for work didn't see you off
When you were tense didn't give a massage
I never told you I think you're hot

It's funny I never thought about it that way
Never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world, thinking I'm a perfect lady

You should've told me, I wasn't small enough
You should've told me, I didn't call enough
But you led me on and kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time

You should've told me, I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me, I didn't smile enough
What you had in mind made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

When you thought you had to lie
Why didn't you come and tell me why?
Didn't you see those tears I cried?
Oh, why?

You should've told me, I wasn't small enough
You should've told me, I didn't call enough
But you led me on and kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time

You should've told me, I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me, I didn't smile enough
What you had in mind made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

You should've told me, I wasn't small enough
You should've told me, I didn't call enough
But you led me on and kept me going

Changing Faces,That Other Woman,"I can't be that other woman
I can't be that other woman

You only see me every Friday night at 9
Can't imagine whatchu told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face

First to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends just to cover your trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie

Why am I crying every night over you?
You're never gonna leave her
Finally, I woke up and smelt the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down cant keep creapin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more

Can't be that other woman
I can't love it down cant keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more

You never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won't return my page
You take my body in the middle of the night
I ain't gon lie 'coz boy you do it so right

And then you melt me with them same 3 words
Sweetest seduction that I ever heard
And in the morning at the sun rise
You run to her, I realize

Why am I crying every night over you?
Your never gonna leave her
Finally, I woke up and smelt the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

Can't be that other woman

Can I get a witness
(Yes, you can)

Can I get a witness
(Oh, yeh, oh, yeh, yeh, yeh)
You said, you'd leave a thousand time
But I wont believe till the papers are signed

I can't be that other woman
I wont believe it no
I gotta be the only one
Yes, I want you bad but she needs you much more

Can't be that other woman
I can't look it down cant keep creapin' around
Can't be that other woman

But she needs you much more

In the morning with the sunrise
You will run to her
No, you're never gonna leave her
So I'm saying, goodbye

In the morning with the sunrise
You will run to her
No, you're never gonna leave her

then i woke up in those loving arms of yours,
what i felt was unmistakable
when i fell for you

it was real, it was magic,
it was calm, it was savage
it was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch,
it was never enough, it was always too much,
it did all the things love does,
that's how i knew it was

who thought that i could laugh so loud,
then turn around and cry so many tears?
i used to have so many doubts,
but one by one you made them disappear,
but what i found was unbelievable, i believe it's true

it was real, it was magic,
it was calm it was savage
it was cool as a breeze, it was warm to the touch,
it was never enough, it was always too much,
it did all the things love does,

you asked what i felt when you walked through the door,
was it fear, was it clear, it was all that and more,

Where my bitch at? Look a hot girl is a silent hoe
If a bitch get outta line she a violent hoe
Ain't no pest, far from being a whining hoe
Fuck up she confess, she ain't no lyin hoe
That's what I need, a hot girl is a jazzy bitch
I'd take her any day for a classy bitch
On the down low for her nigga she a nasty bitch
I tell her touch it, she gon' reach down and grab the dick
I bust a nut, it's soft, she get it back hard
The police kick in the door she take the charge
If a nigga goto jail she run for a nigga
Money orders, business, and go run for a nigga
she be a nigga ballin, would get bout it for her nigga
lemme come thorugh, hit the stash, and walk up by the nigga
I can't see no other bitch for the B.G.

Jay-Z,Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up),"Yeah, Roc-A-Fella, y'all know what this is
We givin' y'all five seconds to put your drinks down
An' report to the dance floor immediately
All the bustas, we givin' y'all five seconds to get close to an exit
It's about to get real ugly in here, five seconds is up, let's go

Throw the hands up
Throw the hands up, niggaz
Throw the hands up, bitches
Throw the hands up, bustas

Throw the hands up, hustlers
Throw the hands up, hos
Throw the hands up, posta's
Throw the hands up, Mac

You know how Mac come through on the club tip
Everybody real deep on that thug shit
Cop Cris' spray the club on that thug shit
Cop frisks suits, snub in the club quick

Told y'all real high, when I come through
You can try if you want to, you can die if you want to
We hittin' whores on the floor, whole crew be wild
Bitch, 'Back that ass up' like Juvenile

When my peeps come to spend a dime a piece
You know Mac come through with a line of freaks
Every bitch on the hit be a 9 at least
We gettin' head on the floor, while you grindin' freaks

Whole squad get it down like this
Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound of twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit
In case a clown wanna flip

Mac never slip in a club, told y'all niggas 4/5th in a club
If a nigga wanna draw, then the blood, it can drip in the club
You know how niggaz get in the club, shit, you know how I be
All high in VIP, rollin' up to B.I.G.

Niggaz be all liquored up, talkin' shit
'Til they man gotta an' come pick 'em up
Got bitches in the back bouncin' to 'Jigga what?'
You got your hands up an' I ain't even stick y'all up

Everybody get it up, throw the hands up
Everybody get it up, throw the hands up

12 A.M., on my way to the club

Yo, how the fuck you gonna talk about MCs on our hill?
When we just cop them things, homey, the chromy wheels
Both arms are chunky the sleeves on chill
Any given times a 100 Gs in your grill

Don't talk to me 'bout MCs got skillz
He's alright but he's not real
Jay-Z's that deal with seeds in a field
Never fear for war, hug, squeeze that steel

Fuck, you gotta a flow, that's cool with me
You gotta lil' dough, that's cool with me
You gotta little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all motherfuckers could fool with me

You know the wrist frostbit, minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked, can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me

Niggaz shift two million, then I blew the three
Then I skated the four, before I went on tour
I came back an' it's plain, y'all niggaz ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang

I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows, tryin' to wild out
The game is ours, will never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out

Throw your hands up
Niggaz, bitches, bustas, hustlers
Fuck that
Throw the hands up

12 A.M., on the way to the club

2 A.M., now I'm checkin' the mix
3 A.M., now he buyin' me drinks

"Price, Kelly",As We Lay,"It's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back the hands of time, oh no no

Yes, we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away

It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face
A new day
Brings reality and we must go our separate ways

What a lovely night we had
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we caused
As we slept the night away

As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Ooh hey, hey

As we lay
Didn't think about
The price we'd have to pay
No, no, no

It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye baby, you're leaving me
I know you've got to hurry home to face your wife, wife

I would never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

I would never, never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Oh, no no

As we lay
We didn't think about
The price we'd have to pay
Oh no, no, no

We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second, in the minute
In the hours, hey, hey, hey

As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Oh no, oh no, no

My love, why can't you see
How loving you is killing me, baby, baby
I can't think of no one else

You see, I can't be in your life
You gotta go home to your wife
Oh, it's morning"

Nigga service with a smile
Suck my dick

And I'm about to make you lose yours too
From far away one time

Private Emotion

Every endless night has a dawning day 
Every darkest sky has a shining ray 
And it shines on you baby can't you see 
You're the only one who can shine for me

[CHORUS:] It's a private emotion that fills you tonight 
And a silence falls between us 
As the shadows steal the light 
And wherever you may find it 
Wherever it may lead 
Let your private emotion come to me 
Come to me

When your soul is tired and your heart is weak 
Do you think of love as one way street 
Well it runs both ways, open up your eyes 
Can't you see me here, how can you deny

[CHORUS]

Every endless night has a dawning day 
Every darkest sky has a shining ray 
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by 
But you can find me here till your tears run dry

Nine Days,If I Am,"So you're standin' on the ledge
It looks like you might fall
Its so far down
Or maybe you were thinkin' about jumpin'

Now you could have it all
If you learned a little patience
For though I cannot fly
I'm not content to crawl

So give me a little credit
Have in me a little faith
I wanna be with you forever
If tomorrow's not too late

But it's always too late
When you got nothing, to you say
You should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises today

If I am, another waste of everythin'
You dreamed of, I will let you down
If I am, only here to watch you
As you suffer, I will let you down

So you're walkin' on the edge
And you wait your turn to fall
But you're so far gone
That you don't see the hands upheld to catch you

And you could find the fault
In' the heart that you've been handed
For though you cannot fly
You're not content to crawl

And it's always too late
When you got nothin, so you say
But we should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises

If I am, another waste of everythin'
You hoped for, I will let you down
If I am, only here to watch you
As you suffer, I will let you down

So you're standin' on the ledge
It looks like you might fall

If I am, another waste of everythin'
You dreamed of, I will let you down
If I am, only here to watch you
As you suffer, I will let you down

The answers we find
Are never what we had in mind
So we make it up
As we go along

You don't talk of dreams
When I won't mention tomorrow
And we won't make
Those promises we can't keep

I will never leave you
I will not let you down
I will never leave you
I will not let you down"
"Blige, Mary J.",Give Me You,"I don't ask for too many things
Only one thing I really need
That is you baby next to me
With that I'm satisfied
Don't need diamonds, I don't need gold
I just need someone here to hold
To keep me warm when the nights are cold
That would do just fine, just fine

You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me love, inside your heart
And that's enough
Baby, that's enough

(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you

That's enough for me, baby

I don't need things that money buys
All I need is there in your eyes
I just need your heart next to mine
All my whole life through

You don't have to bring the moon to me
Just bring me the love, the love that I need
And that's enough
Oh baby, that's enough

Just promise me that I have your heart
You don't have to bring the world to me
Just give me your word, you will never leave
'Cause having you beside me
I have everything I need

So give me, give me you
(Give me you, give me all of you)
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need, oh

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Californication,"Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker then the rest there is no test
But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Third Eye Blind,Deep Inside Of You,"When we met, light was shed
Thoughts free flow
You said you've got something
Deep inside of you

A wind chime voice sounds
Sway of your hips 'round rings true
It goes deep inside of you
These secret garden beams
Change my life so it seems

A fall breeze blows outside
I don't break stride
Thoughts are warm
And they go deep inside of you

Oh yeah
Well I never felt alone
Alright
Oh oh uh, oh oh uh
Till I met you

Friends say I've changed
I don't listen
'Cause I live to be
Deep inside of you

Slide up her dress
Shouts in darkness
I'm so alive

I'm deep inside of you
You said boy made girl feel good
But still, deep inside

Still
I never felt alone, till I met you
I'm alright on my own
And then I met you
And I'd know what to do
If I just knew, what's comin'

I would change myself if I could
I walk with my people if I could find them
And I'd say that I'm sorry to you
I'm sorry to you

And I don't wanna call you
But then I wanna call you
'Cause I don't wanna crush you
But I feel like crushing you

And it's true, I took for granted
You were with me
I breathe by your looks
And you look right through me

(Didn't know it)
(We were broken)
(Didn't know it)
(We were broken)

(All)

Somethings gone
You're withdrawn
I'm not strong, like before
I was deep inside of you

I can go nowhere
I burn candles and stare
At a ghost
Deep inside of you

And some great need in me
Starts to bleed, I've lost myself
There's nothin' left, it's all gone
Deep inside of you

Deep inside of you
Mmmm
Deep inside of you"
"Brooks, Garth",Do What You Gotta Do,"Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If your gonna walk down on the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
'Cause sometimes it comes down to do what you gotta do

Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on, boy, all the way through
Sometimes it comes down to do what you gotta do

Well there's people that'll tell you, it's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you that you're gonna lose
People that'll tell you anything you're gonna listen to
Do what you gotta do

Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for someone to blame
What's your name boy? Hey you just tell them true
'Cause they can't take the truth from you, so do what you gotta do

Well they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that sooner or later

"Anthony, Marc",My Baby You,"As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life's worth a thousand skies

You're the simplest love I've known
And the purest one I'll own
Know, you'll never be alone

My baby
You are the reason I could fly
And because of you
I don't have to wonder why

Baby, you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive

Though these words I sing are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do

How do I explain that smile?
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

My baby
You are the reason I could fly
And 'cause of you
I don't have to wonder why

Baby, you
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive

I will soothe you if you fall
I'll be right there if you call
You're my greatest love of all

You are the reason I could fly

We need a break from the same old thing of nothin' new

Want to go out on a limb, on a whim, yeah

Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah

I'll tell you this I want a kiss I want a long kiss
The kind of deep that moves the ground
Thing you used to do to me
I want to dance a little, dream a little baby, just live a little
Make my heart rate elevate bring it up a few degrees

Get me goin' with the wind, now and then, yeah

To the joint in the club, in the car if it groove
Broad look, the movement is on

Findin' it very hard to make it over the wall

Hope you skippin' every line 'cause I'm gettin' mine

Penetration is methodically slow
Mountain high valley low, gonna find the dough

We gonna satisfy the urge and discover the need
You feel, you feel the bite in this
If you think I'm type real then invite me miss
And let me say a rhyme in your ear

Weaves it's spell upon your heart

Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggaz murder off top, boy

We don't know what be goin cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day til we ""400 Degreez""

And ever since the coke drought, niggaz been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin wit
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hahhhh, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggaz that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up put em in the vans, then put a gat in his jaws

2 Pac,Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II),"I feel you, baby don't
But you can't, you can't give up
Hey 2Pac what?

Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up, Outlawz
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up keep ya head up

Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while

I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat so when she asked me
""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through

I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated they chased and they raped me

Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No you got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

Baby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up

Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up baby don't cry

Forget him girl forget him girl he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could loev you, but he in love with the struggle

Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo' gettin' mo'
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions fo' sho'
Uh, oh now you 'bout to have his baby? Dayamn
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy

You got too much, mo', livin' to do I'm spittin' this to you
'Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you that's right
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she

Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everything you need, feel me? Don't cry

Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up you'll be alright
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up you'll be alright

Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up keep your head up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up baby don't cry

I'm tryin' to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin' you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? Damn

I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father everyday and they don't know who he is

Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her pampers and food just to stop through
But those, ain't my seeds, nuttin' really I could do nah

I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she 'bout to O D from the pressure
Hell nah I won't let her, baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up you'll be alright
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up baby, baby, baby
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up no
Even when the road is hard, never give up no ohh

Baby don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up

"Wallflowers, The",Sleepwalker,"Maybe I could be the one they adore
That could be my reputation
It's where I'm from that lets them think I'm a whore
I'm an educated virgin

And sleepwalker, don't be shy
And don't open your eyes tonight
You'll be the one that defends my life
When I'm dead asleep dreamin'

Cupid, don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine, the sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried

Now let me in, let me drown or learn how to swim
Just don't leave me at the window
I could be the one to be your next best friend
You may need someone to hold you

And sleepwalker, take this knife
Now you may see someone tonight
You'd be the one that saves my life
When I'm dead asleep dreamin'

Now Cupid, don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine, the sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried

I'm in your movie and everyone looks sad
But I can hear you, your voice, the laugh track
But you never saw my best scene
The one where I sleep, I sleepwalk into your dreams

Now, sleepwalker, what's my line
Now it's only a matter of time
Until I learn to open up my eyes
When I'm dead asleep dreamin'

Now Cupid, don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine, the sleepwalker in me
Now, the sleepwalker in me
Now, the sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried"
Drama,"Left, Right, Left","Ohh, I been hurtin' lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know that I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

Hmmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
(Left, right, left, right, left)
I'm moving on, I got no regrets
(Left, right, left, right, left)

I said times are changing, tell me how can I keep up
Every time that I turn around there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted
And you're lost without me
Yeah you gotta walk alone, yeah it's true
Flash every smile cause I've been lost for miles
I know you've felt this way before too

We're almost there baby one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving on, we got no regrets
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, we're almost there only one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left

Mmm I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We're almost there baby one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving forward and there's no regrets
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who can be the boss?
Look up to the Cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm dashin' all the media strikes, keep the media dykes
As re enforcements for the fight
And that alone will keep John Gotti on the phone
Yea
Tangled in his own
I got the Bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?
(Tical)
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now
(Shut the fuck up)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round
I'll knock him out
They call me Big John Stud
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood
What up doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd, the sure shot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged
(Plugged)
Learn
Temperature's too hot for sunblock
(Burn)
Playin' with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa Bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
'Cause it's your blood
Murder is tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us, they know not what they do, our praises do
I'm big like easy, ya big bamboo
What's that, I didn't hear you?

Who hold crown?
Protect land with both pound
Limp Bizkit, get around like merry go
What's the scenario?
Comin' through your stereo
Why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals
Delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out their front teethes
Tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the baseline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticle
Where you find that monster?
She beautiful
Wu Tang and Limp Bizkit
(Limp Bizkit)
Roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker
Pull the plug and then jet
Mic check
So what's it all about?
Where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised, for the blood of virgin eyes
Limpin' on the track with Method
So get the sunblock
You get your one shot, until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone, without a microphone
(Phone)
But don't you forget you're in the zone
(So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those who didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu Tang clan for the crown

When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round
I got a woman that fills my heart so full that it overflows
And how it gets any better than this, brother, I don't know

Yankee Grey,Another Nine Minutes,"Six thirty in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me

I wrestle with the feeling
That the day's starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end

But we gotta get moving
Can't eat if we don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Let's pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it
For another nine minutes

I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I want to stay in it

Oh yeah, for another nine minutes let the world wait
Whose gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
For another nine minutes let the world wait
Whose gonna care if we're a little bit late

Another nine minutes

Well this had been comin' for a long, long time

I've got a shotgun, a rifle
And a four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'till dawn
Make our own whiskey
And our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these ol' boys can't do
Including Bocephus

We grow good ol' tomatoes
And homemade wine
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive in the millenium
We say grace
And we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the rocky mountains and the western skies
If the bank machines crash
We'll be just fine
'Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me Bocephus
Called me hillbilly
Really

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For forty-three dollars my friend lost his life
Now this dude's gonna get out in a year or two
'Cause the system don't work for me and you
But a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out

And south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
If the bank machine's crash
We'll be just fine
And a country boy can survive

Country folks can survive
Country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
Any year, anytime"
"Cagle, Chris",My Love Goes On And On,"My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

There's only so many stars in the night
That can make up a milky way
Oh and there ain't more than
Twenty four long hours in a day

But they say everything has a limit
Yeah that ain't exactly true
'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart
Or the way that I feel about you

Hell even when the pyramids are gone

Yeah my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

Well I got two hundred thousand miles
On a rusty old beat up truck
And I hate to say but there's gonna come a day
When I'm gonna have to give her up

But darlin' since I met you
Well here is how it is
I could live with losing everything
But I would die without your kiss

So if you think this fire we lit inside
Will burn out, you're wrong

My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

Yeah I know that we can't spend every waking hour together
But I can hold you tonight and I can love you forever

Every time I think of what we've got
All I do is smile
'Cause the beginning to the end of time
Compared to this is a little while

Well I've heard raindrops will turn into oceans
And oceans will turn to dust
But there ain't a single force in the world
That'll have an effect on us

Well it may be
That the rugged Rocky Mountains don't last long

But my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on"
"Byrd, Tracy",Put Your Hand In Mine,"He sat up on the bed and he watched me packing
He already knew why I was leavin'
I took what I needed but I sure left a lot still hanging
But I figured I'd get it come the weekend

He said, ""Daddy when you get there
Are you gonna have a refrigerator""
I kinda laughed and said I guess I will
Then he handed me a tracing of his hand
On the back of a piece of paper
And a magnet and my heart stood still, when he said

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine

But I drove past the hardin' baptist church
Though it wasn't really on the way to my hotel
Beside me on the seat I was looking at five small fingers
When I heard the chapel bell and it took me

Back another life ago when our hearts were open
Oh, back when we could still agree
Back when the future that we had was full of hope and
You and I we got down on our knees and said

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
Put your hand in mine

I couldn't even stay away one night
I noticed you left on the light
And I've only got one thing to say
If you're not too tired and it's not too late

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be here all the time
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be here to lift you up again
Would you reach out to me one more time
And put your hand in mine
Would you reach out to me just one more time
And put your hand in mine"

Freaky-freaky

Ay yo, I got a resolution, this year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year, where you can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature

I was young and having money, having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'

No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash, let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips, and break 'em with long dick

There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi, that still can buy weed
And can give me some good head and I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough

Yo, yo, yo, yo the only thing Bleek spinning is, them chrome wheels
Spinning on them new rims, home suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?

It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain, love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave

Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block
Rappin' thug, the Roc, hoes they all clock like

I was the worse, I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like I wish he was gay
'Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay

I'll have your chick in the tropics summer sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away

Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said, she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is she

"Levert, Gerald",Mr. Too Damn Good,"OOooooo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oohhhhhhh Yeah
Ummmm hmmmm

Guess you never know a good thing
When it's right in your face
you've been abused for so long
Love gets tainted and all seems the same
I guess it's unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well time ain't no object and money ain't a thing
When you have someone to ease your pain

Wanna be the smile on your face
Be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed
And baby I'll be your food
Mr. Too Damn Good To You

Yes sir, hmm
you've been hurt so many times
You don't know when love's for real
So you don't open up
Or give in to love
Or express how you feel
But just like Sunday Morning
I take it easy
Girl I'm gonna wait
Cause lovin' just ain't right
Without you by my side
Baby you're my soul mate
Baby I'll open doors
Be there for you any time
Cause that's what your man's supposed to do
Baby I wanna cook for you
I will spoil you
Girl my whole objective is to please you
I'll run your bubble bath
Make you laugh
Girl through thick and thin Ive got your back
I ain't gon be pressin' you or stressin' you to make love

"McKnight, Brian",Stay Or Let It Go,"What's up girl? I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playin' myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's not my fault that you made yourself a regretful past
But all I know is, it makes me look bad
When I'm holdin' your hand and you see old friends you knew
And they walk away laughin', callin' me a fool

Now baby, I can't change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl, I love you
So tell me what am I to do? yeah

Don't know if we would last
And if we do last can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, could you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
But you gave your attention to someone across the room
I should have known right then that things just weren't right
But I couldn't see it 'cause love had me so blind

Now tell me how can I be so secure in lovin' you
When everybody's callin' me a fool
I can't keep holdin' on to broken promises from you
And I can't take no more from you, yeah

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Baby, baby, time and time again I try to overlook the pain
Couldn't think of losin' all we had to gain
Girl, if it takes me losing you, for happiness in me
I think that I might just have to let you go, oh

Why you playing those games, huh?
I don't see how you'll do it when I walk out the door

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we will last
And if we do last, can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Should I stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go?"
"Allan, Gary",Smoke Rings In The Dark,"Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman
I'm a different kind of man

I've tried to make you love me
You've tried to find a spark
Of the flame that burned
But somehow turned to smoke rings in the dark

The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey
Through an empty aching soul

And the night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark

I know I must be going
'Cause love's already gone
And all I'm taking with me
Are the pieces of my heart
And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark

The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still

So, I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark

I know I must be going
'Cause loves already gone
And all I'm taking with me
Are the pieces of my heart
And all I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark"

Montgomery Gentry,Daddy Won't Sell The Farm,"His cows get loose and run
Right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls
When they're downwind from his hogs

When his tractor backs up traffic
The reception ain't too warm
The city's growing around him
But Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm
There's concrete all around him but Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

One day he's gonna leave it all to me
And I'll start my own branch of the family tree
They'll get the message written on the roof of the barn
Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

We're gonna live and die
In the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm
Oh you know a country boy can survive"
"Cyrus, Billy Ray",You Won't Be Lonely Now,"I know you seen all your dreams turn to dust
I know your hearts been left in the rain to rust
But you wont be lonely now

I see the long trail of tears in your eyes
Back to the day when the innocence died
But you wont be lonely now

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely
You wont be lonely now

Holding you here like a rose in the dark
I make this promise to you from my heart
You wont be lonely now

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely now
I'll do anything to make you see
How I'm gonna love you
You wont be lonely
You wont be lonely

Now that your here in my arms I'm alive
For the first time in a long time I
Look at my face in the mirror and see
The man I've wanted to be, oh yeah, woo ooh

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely now
I'll do anything to make you see
How I'm gonna love you
You wont be lonely
You wont be lonely
You wont be lonely now"
Clark Family Experience,Meanwhile Back At The Ranch,"Traffic jams, commuter lines
Monthly quotas, the daily grind
In a hurry and out of time
The pressure's on

They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge

[CHORUS]
Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Sitting on the front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche
Meanwhile, back at the ranch

The big computer's on the blink
Y2K, what a stink
They bring the city to the brink
But not out here

The only thing that we got on line
Is the fish we caught for suppertime
Well, let me tell you, peace of mind
Is the last frontier

They're pushing and shoving
They're living on the edge

[repeat CHORUS]

Out there crawling
Like ants upon the ground
Oh, go home

Hear them calling
But the sky is falling
Down, down, down, down, down

Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
Sitting on my front porch
Swinging with Blanche
World's running from an avalanche"
"Thomas, Carl",Summer Rain,"Storming outside, rain
She keeps me home
Quiet conversation
Makes me warm, so

Summer rain, sweet rain
Whispers me to sleep and wakes me up again, my rain
Sometimes, I swear, I hear her call my name
You wash away the pain
My summer rain

In the middle of the night when I'm alone
I feel her kisses on me
Even when she's gone
Can't wait 'till she gets home

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep and wakes me up again
Sometimes, I swear, I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

I don't mind if it rains forever
Rain, rain, let it rain
I said, I don't mind if it rains forever
Rain, rain, let it rain

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my rain

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep and wakes me up again
Sometimes, I swear, I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

Summer rain
(So, baby, won't you be my summer rain?)
Whispers me to sleep and wakes me up again
(So, baby, won't you be my summer rain?)
Sometimes, I swear, I hear her call my name
(So, baby, won't you be my summer rain?)
To wash away the pain
My summer rain
(So, baby, won't you be my? Would you be my summer rain?)

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
(Baby, would you rain on me?)
Your tender touches wash away my pain

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
(I need you to make it rain, would you do it for me one time?)
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my pain"
"Yearwood, Trisha",Real Live Woman,"I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned

I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am

I ain't a movie star may never see the view from where they are
And this old town may be as far as I'm goin'
And what he'll hold tonight in his hands
He swears there's so much better than
Anything that this old world can show him

I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'

This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman

I work 9-5 and I can't relate
To millionaires who somehow fate
Has smiled upon and fortune made their
Common lives a better place to be

And I no longer justify
Reasons for the way that I behave
I offer no apologies
For the things that I believe and say
And I like it that way

'Cause I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'

This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman"

"Hollister, Dave",Can't Stay,"Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl, things are still the same
Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay

We stay together putting the front on
I'd rather be on my own
When we first met things were fine
We went out to dine

We strolled the beach
Holding hands sharing quality time
What happened between then and now
The love we shared was lost somehow

My friends tried to tell me
That we're moving too fast
But how could I know the feelings would pass
It wouldn't last

I know I should have left a long time ago
But I stayed to see
Still hoping and praying you still love me

Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl, things are still the same
Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay

Listen, I took you in treated your children as mine
Then we laid and made love
And you had my son what a precious time

I did all that I could to get through to you
To let you know girl it's you I was living for
(But you let your mind, play games on you)

Then when I'm not around
You think that I don't know
That you're passing time
With the guy next door

I gave you all that I had
You didn't love me one ounce
So like a basket ball I gotta bounce

Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl, things are still the same
Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay

Listen, baby can you tell me
Where I went wrong? yeah
All I ever wanted, baby, baby, baby
Was a happy home to call my own

I can't take no more
(No doubt)
So I'm telling you, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye

You said things would change

She's the only one for me, she's the only girl I see
I can't seem to find a damn thing wrong with her, Veronica

Your brothers say, it's over now they're looking for me
But I know there's something there that no one can see
It reminds me of Romeo and Juliet like we're living on a movie set
I'm a shark and you're a jet, make your mommy sweat
'Cause she wishes we had never met

She says I just make her world go round, I know 'cause I feel it too
I'm so in love with you

Yeah
Check, check, check, check, uh

Johnny Rocket, got her number in my pocket
We was on the run, daddy got a gun, stop it
Playin' with Veronica, she's got me now
But her brother got a biscuit and it might go pow

I'm shaking to breakin' and makin' and bakin'to do
Wit'cha and yo crew and ain't doin' nothing
But grabbin' a mic and I'm smackin' a mic
And I'm still on beat

You can't stop the blood rush and you can't stop love
So it's time to knuckle up and pray to the Lord above

She says that I just make the world go round, God knows I feel it too
I'm so in love with you

Veronica's the song that's in my head, Veronica's the name I've often said

"Paisley, Brad",Me Neither,"Darlin' I've been standin' here just watchin' you all night
And I think I've even caught you watchin' me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know this may sound dumb, but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight

Me neither, I'm glad that we agree believe me that's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded and this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat, me neither

It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checkin', that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow, you and I should take this slow
And darlin' tell me, would you like to dance

Me neither I was just bein' polite
Thank goodness my feet are much too tired
I'm sure you're tired too, I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while

Me neither, we'd never get along
I'm thinkin' there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time and I'm runnin' outta lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song, me neither

Here we go"

Eve,Got It All,"Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on

Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes you do)
Don't want your jewels
No not at all (Stop lying)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)

Now don't start flippin' it
Everybody know
We've been had dough
Y'all just start gettin' it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice love it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that

Yo, yo ay yo
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough baby Eve alright
Cause if Eve wanna fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all
That's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout

Limp Bizkit,Re-Arranged,"Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately I've been skeptical, silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me who witness we feel and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand, when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go

Of you and me, we're through an' rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to, disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go

Of you and me, we're through and rearranged
You and me, we're through and rearranged
You're no good for me, thank God its over

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin'

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin', cryin' on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin', dyin' on me

You think that everybody is the same
I don't think that anybody is like you

"Spencer, Tracie",Still In My Heart,"Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter 'cause you're still in my heart

Thinkin' of you brings tears to my eyes
Seems yesterday, we were planning our lives
I'm so confused, wonderin' why
How could you leave without sayin' goodbye

Picture your smile inside of my head
Still smell your cologne all over my bed
Miss you so much, I pray every night
That the angels are watching and treating you right

Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter 'cause you're still in my heart

I sing to myself, so nobody hears
There's just no escaping, the sounds of my tears
Miss you so much and every night
I can't get to sleep, it ain't right

Memories keep holding me down
There's just no fun when you're not around
Don't know what to do, now I'm faced with the truth
Somehow I thought that we would always be

Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter 'cause you're still in my heart

Oh, I just want you to know

Nu Flavor,3 Little Words,"Never believed in love at first sight
But I believe what i'm feeling tonight

So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you

I was waiting for a sign from you
Hoping you'd feel the same way too
When you looked at me and smiled
My heart was going a thousand miles
I stopped, turned around
I tried to keep my feet of the ground
As I stepped to you we touched
I knew you were feeling it too because

One look in your eyes
I knew we two would always be together
And there are 3 little words that say it all
I love you

To a little old town without a name
She met a man he took her in
Then fed her all the same bullshit again

'Cause he lied
'Cause he lied
He lied like a salesman sellin' flies

So she screamed
So she screamed
I'ts a different place

Been there a couple of times
Always almost in tears
Living in fear of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you've got
I'll tell you one thing it's not
It's not the kind of love that would turn and run

This one's steady and strong
This one will keep going on and on and on
Till the end of time, it ain't the quittin' kind

You don't have to be scared we're not going back there
We're going to leave it behind
All that sorrow and grief
Those bad memories of the quittin' kind

If you don't know what you've got
I'll tell you one thing it's not

You're facing a hurricane
One more chapter in your journey, yeah
Break through darkness in my life
Like sunshine (yeah)
Now I believe
(I believe baby)
Now I believe that love (yeah)

[kelly, tamar, lov her, kandice]
Love will set you free
I know it's gonna take you higher


If you believe
You just believe
And you will receive

[kandice love]
I opened up with my heart
There was no doubt
That hatred pulls you in
And love pulls you out
If you believe in faith you will never fall
Love will take you higher than any wall

[all]
Love will set you free
(if you believe in love)
Higher
(it will take you higher)
If you just believe
(and higher, oh love, love, love, love, love)
Set you free

Love (believe it)
Sets you free (love will set you free)
Higher (we're gonna take you higher, yeah yeah)
Just believe (love will, oh oh yeah)
If you just believe

(ad lib while:)
Only love can set you free
Love will be everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe

Open up, let it in
It will change everything, really
Love is life, love is free
If you only just believe

Only love can set you free
Love is free, let it be
A little faith, charity
If you just believe

Open up, let it in
It can change everything, really
Love is life, love is free
If you only just believe

Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Going on with you, your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind
Or was it something I should pay attention to?

Then on Tuesday
Having lunch with friends I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if what I saw was true

Wednesday evening
Every time the phone would ring you'd say, ""Hello""
But when I'd come around you'd say, ""I gotta go""
Your friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyra

Ho, now it's Thursday
You left the house to go to work an hour early
Said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home and when I called your job
They said you were not there, oh yeah

Friday night
Is the night we've always had our weekend date
But you showed up at the house extremely late
Without any conversation
You just went to bed and said that you're head ached

Now it's the weekend
And you know that it's the day I do my cleaning
And when I washed your shirts I just could not believe
I'm picking hair weave off your sleeve
Found a letter in your pocket from Louise, please

"Herndon, Ty",No Mercy,"Don't think I'm sorry is what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door

A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby till I can't take anymore

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
(No mercy, show me no mercy)

Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight

Remember when we thought that being apart
Would be the best thing for both our hearts
It's a prison out there when you're living alone for sure

Now I know how much I really missed you
No more games, just wanna be with you
Just give me all your love till you can't give anymore

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
(No mercy, show me no mercy)

Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight

In the silence of the early hours
I look at you and I feel the power
Don't need promises to make it right
Let's just follow what we're feeling inside

No mercy, show me no mercy tonight

Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight
(No mercy, show me no mercy)

No mercy, show me no mercy tonight

Love me strong and show me no mercy tonight

Your taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Had it up to here
I made the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't gonna say
You say you didn't go out
I know that was a lie
The neighbors said they saw you
Last night driving by

What's up with this girl?
Some supermarket clerk
Is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more

No more kisses
We won't make it up
I'm tired of your shit
I've had enough
If I had three wishes
You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate
Like 1-2-3 and

It's gon' be you 'cause it's my condo
The two of us can't be up in here
So one of us is gonna make it clear

There's no laying 'round, no free rides
No playing around, that's a rule of mine
But you were cheating 'round
Trying to ride for free
If it worked, I'd dream of genie
I'd blink your ass away from me

No more kisses

Dancing Queen
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

(chorus)
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

Dig in the dancing queen...
Dig in the dancing queen...
Dig in the dancing queen..."

Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

I don't care about what you think, you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you

I wish that you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want
(Right)
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thought ways when you're handlin' the candelabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that, uhh

Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh
Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni, yeah, you wanted extra cheese
Sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory

I was Moses, hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some no's to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile

Now catch a curve from my kick
(Or show me lovin' by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh
Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh
Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh
Ooh noo-ohh, noo-ohh

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed

That's the truth
Things ain't goin like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here

Keep a clear head, tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed
Like deer heads upon the wall
So all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you

They come to hear you play
And drink and dance
The night away

I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream to mind
But you don't know
You don't even know that I'm there

I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night, till the dawn

I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through all night long
All night long I'd be your song, I'd be your song

Fill my heart with
Every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday, yeah

I long to be the one that
You caress with a tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

I wish that I was in your arms

And you would play me

Tuesday,I Know,"Holding me close, he's always protected me
The calm in the storm, the joy that surrounds me
But left in my chains my emotions take over
My soul could be dead, but you've never left me

I never knew your heart 'til now
I never knew your soul
I'm crazy about the way he walks, the things he'll do
But now I know - I love you

It breaks me apart, oh like no other
My selfishness grows and my emotions take over
But wherever I am or how betrayed I become
I know that you will stand by me when all else is gone

Yeah the one thing I know is your love is constant
And brokenness comes but you will take me away from this place
Once again

Time goes by (fruit bears every slowly)
Joy returns (in spite of my impatience)
Life comes back (she'll get back up)
He strengthens her (however weak she may be)"
LL Cool J,Imagine That,"Just how practical she is
[Incomprehensible], baby
I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh, yeah, yeah

Uh, yeah, I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know, sex 'em up a little bit
You know, what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm ridin' by
The one givin' me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hittin' your thigh
Actin' like my chrome twenties ain't catchin' your eye

Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turnin' me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough

I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between

Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby, I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny

Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss, let that nigga hear you scream
Soundin' like that screech on the fax machine

Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a raccoon
Touch yourself, baby, tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

I'ma get you for your paper, make you leave ya girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)

Have you callin' me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)

Knockin' girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh, uh)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl, you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass

I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick, baby, we both red hot

I kiss your neck, unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe, I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight

You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree

Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tongue on my dimples
Baby, feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it

I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twistin', kissin' ya fist like that

Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby, hold that
You a bad girl, look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so I never forget the teacher's pet

I'ma get you for your paper, make you leave ya girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)

Have you callin' me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)

Knockin' girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh, uh)

You was laughin' with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights

I'm rockin' the tank top, baby, nothin' but ice
You rockin' the, baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants

You bold huh, you wanna grab it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it, 'cause you know that I want it
God, gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it

Let's drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd separated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb

We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt, I put some ice in between

You're tired from the dancin', so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside, I hear the bass from the beat
Funk master Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep

No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go

I'ma get you for your paper, make you leave ya girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)

Have you callin' me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide

Ghostface Killah,Cherchez LaGhost,"Tommy Mattola lives on the road
He lost his lady two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh, wonder that love

Brothers try to pass me but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?

Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, stop
(Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these
(She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin'
Put a Ruff Ryder on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime

We passin' it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas

They'll take all your rhymes
With a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second
Then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby? Yeah

Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, oh, yeah
Now he's alone, he's just the King of his throne
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah

Toca's Miracle

If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say 
I feel your touch
Your kiss, it's not enough 
And if you believe in me 
Don't think my love's not for real
I won't take nothin' less then a deeper love 

[Chorus:]
Let me tell you 
You, no I,
I need a miracle 
I need a miracle
Its more physical than 
What I need to feel from you 

[Repeat Chorus]

Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayer
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me

[Repeat Chorus]"
